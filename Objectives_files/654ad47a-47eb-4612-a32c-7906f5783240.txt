I'm going all in for this datathon - I want to crush it and come out on top! I'm willing to put in the extra hours, exhaust my creativity, and pour my heart into this competition. I'm hoping to use this experience to test my skills, learn new strategies, and prove to myself that I have what it takes to be a serious contender. Bring it on, I'm ready to give it my all and walk away with the top spot! Hey there! I'm Luna Sousa, a 22-year-old student going all out for this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or tinkering with tech projects that make a social impact. I've got a can-do attitude and a willingness to roll up my sleeves to get the job done. With a solid foundation in programming and a passion for data science, I'm ready to bring my A-game to this competition. My goal is to push myself to new heights and have a blast doing it. Let's see what we're made of!
