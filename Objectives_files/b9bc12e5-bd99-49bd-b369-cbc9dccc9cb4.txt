For this datathon, my goal is to dive deep into the challenge and take away as much as I can from the experience. I'm a learner at heart, so I'm excited to absorb new concepts, techniques, and insights that I can apply to my studies and future projects. I'm not necessarily interested in competing to win, but rather in leveling up my skills and expanding my knowledge in areas like machine learning and data visualization. I hope to leave this datathon feeling more confident and equipped to tackle complex problems. Hi, I'm Alejandra Joy Thompson, an 18-year-old second-year student. I'm all about learning and growing as a programmer. I've been fascinated by the tech world since I started dabbling in coding a few years ago, and I love the feeling of figuring out a tricky problem. As a curious and creative person, I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies that can help me solve real-world challenges. For this datathon, I'm excited to dive into the world of machine learning and data visualization and take away valuable skills and knowledge to apply to my studies and future projects.
