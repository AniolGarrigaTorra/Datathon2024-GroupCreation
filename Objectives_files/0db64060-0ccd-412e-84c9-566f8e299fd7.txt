Hey! So, I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! My main goal is to dive in and learn as much as I can. I've had some experience with programming, but I'm looking to level up my skills and explore new tools and techniques. I'd love to take on new challenges, ask questions, and get feedback from others. My objective is to come out of this datathon with a bunch of new knowledge and some practical experience under my belt. Bring it on! Hi everyone! I'm Mariona, a 19-year-old student diving into my second year. I'm excited to be here, as I've been itching to upgrade my coding skills and explore new tools. With a passion for creative pursuits like music and art, I enjoy problem-solving and seeing the technical side of things. I've had a taste of programming, and I'm now looking to take it to the next level. I'm open to challenges, eager to ask questions, and thrive on feedback. Let's collaborate, learn from each other, and create something amazing!
