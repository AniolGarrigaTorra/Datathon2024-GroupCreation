My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm here to crush it and take home that trophy. With only a year of programming experience under my belt, I'm eager to put my skills to the test and see how far I can go. I've done one hackathon before and it was an amazing experience, but I didn't quite get the results I wanted. This time, I'm all about strategy and execution. I'll be focusing on my ideas, iterating rapidly, and pushing myself to produce the best possible solution. Hey there! I'm Luciana Rosa Edwards, an 18-year-old coding enthusiast. As a first-year student with a year's worth of programming experience, I'm ready to put my skills to the test. I've got a passion for creative problem-solving, art, and music in my blood, which I'm hoping to infuse into my tech ventures. When I'm not geeking out over code, I love experimenting with lifehacks and exploring new design trends. I'm all about fast-paced innovation and iteration, so buckle up - I'm here to make an impact at this datathon!
