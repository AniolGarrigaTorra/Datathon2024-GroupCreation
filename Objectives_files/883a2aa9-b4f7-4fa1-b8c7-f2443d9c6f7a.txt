Hey there! As a 19-year-old student, I'm heading to this datathon to level up my skills. My goal is to learn as much as I can about data science, especially in Python and visualization. I'm aiming to improve my coding skills, learn new libraries and techniques, and get hands-on experience working with real-world datasets. I'm also excited to dive deeper into machine learning and try out some projects that might come up. It's a chance for me to take my data skills to the next level, and I'm super pumped about it! Hey everyone! I'm SÃ²nia, a 19-year-old student here to take my data skills to the next level. I've got a passion for productivity and problem-solving, which is why I'm stoked to be diving into the world of data science. As a developer, I've got a background in coding and am looking to expand my skill set to Python and visualization. I'm a curious and creative person, and I love combining art and tech to create something new and innovative. I'm excited to learn from others and contribute to the datathon! Let's get started!
