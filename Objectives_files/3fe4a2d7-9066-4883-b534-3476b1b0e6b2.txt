Hey! So, my main goal for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and have a blast while doing it. I'm all about making new friends and connections, and I'm super excited to be surrounded by like-minded people who are just as passionate about data as I am. I want to participate in as many events as I can, from workshops to competitions, and just enjoy the overall vibe of the datathon. Let's make this a unforgettable weekend, together! Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a 19-year-old student with a passion for data and all the excitement it brings. I'm entering my second year, and I'm loving every bit of it - especially the programming courses. When I'm not geeking out over code, you can find me exploring the world of e-commerce and retail, or diving deep into the world of blockchain. I'm all about making connections, learning from others, and having a good time. I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon, and I can't wait to see what this weekend has in store!
