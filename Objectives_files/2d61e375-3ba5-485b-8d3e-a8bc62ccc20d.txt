For me, this datathon is about leveling up my skills! As a second-year student with a solid foundation in programming, I'm eager to dive deeper into machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing. I want to take advantage of the opportunity to learn from mentors, peers, and industry experts, and apply what I've learned to real-world problems. By participating, I aim to improve my technical skills, develop problem-solving strategies, and expand my knowledge in areas I'm new to. The competitive edge is a bonus, but it's not my primary focus - my priority is personal growth and professional development! Hi there!
