Honestly, my main goal for this datathon is to have a blast and make some new friends! I've been to a few hackathons before, but I've always been focused on just getting through the problems and learning from the experience. This time, I want to relax, have fun, and see what I can come up with just for the sake of creation. I'd love to attend some workshops, play some Datathon challenges, and see if I can learn some new tricks. Most of all, I'm looking forward to meeting new people who share my passion for coding and data - let's make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Alex, a 19-year-old student just trying to navigate this whole coding thing. I've been around the block a few times, having participated in a few hackathons before. But to be honest, I've always been super focused on just solving the problems and learning as much as I can. This time, I'm looking to have a blast and connect with like-minded people! I love playing games, tinkering with life hacks, and figuring out new ways to make things more efficient. Can't wait to see what this datathon brings!
