Hey there! My goal for this datathon is all about vibes, man! I'm stoked to be here, not to crush it competitively, but to hang loose, learn new stuff, and meet awesome people. I want to make meaningful connections, swap war stories, and share laughs with fellow datathon warriors. I'm down to participate in as many events as I can, from coding challenges to jam sessions, just to absorb the energy and enthusiasm. Bring it on, and let's have a blast together! Hey there! I'm Marie-Cecilia, a third-year student with a passion for making the most out of life. When I'm not diving into my textbooks, you can find me jamming to indie tunes or whipping up a new life hack to streamline my productivity. For the datathon, I'm looking to relax, learn, and connect with like-minded folks who vibe on the same frequency. I'm all about finding that sweet spot where creativity and coding meet. I'm stoked to be here and see where the adventure takes me!
