Hey there! As a participant, I'm all about having a blast and meeting new people! My main objective for this datathon is to soak up the vibes, learn something new, and hang out with fellow geeks. I'm not too fussed about winning or taking home the top prize (although, let's be real, it'd be cool if I did!). Instead, I'm excited to attend as many workshops, meetups, and social events as possible, and make some amazing friends along the way. Can't wait to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and have some serious fun! Hi there! I'm Pilar Cristina Fletcher, a 21-year-old student with a thirst for learning and adventure. I'm currently in my third year, and I'm excited to be participating in this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me trying out new android apps or tinkering with IoT projects. I'm all about using my skills to make a positive impact, and I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts to share ideas and make some amazing friends. Let's grab coffee and talk all things tech!
