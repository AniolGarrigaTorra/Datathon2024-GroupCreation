My goal for this datathon is to level up my skills! As a student with only a beginner level of experience in programming, I'm eager to dive into new technologies and approaches. I want to learn from others, pick up tips and tricks, and challenge myself to overcome obstacles. My aim is to take home practical knowledge and experience that I can apply to my studies and future projects. I'm excited to collaborate with others, ask questions, and be surrounded by fellow coding enthusiasts who are on a similar journey. Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a second-year student with a passion for tech and a hunger to learn. As a coding newbie, I'm excited to dive into new areas and take on new challenges. I'm hoping to level up my skills, share ideas with others, and soak up as much knowledge as possible. Data analysis is a mystery I'm eager to unravel, and I'm counting on this datathon to help me get there. I'm a collaborative person at heart, and I'm looking forward to teaming up with others to achieve our goals and have some fun along the way!
