My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win! With one hackathon under my belt, I'm confident in my abilities to tackle tough challenges. I'm not looking to make any new friends (not that that wouldn't be cool), nor am I here to sit back and just learn (although, I mean, I'll definitely be learning). Nope, I'm all about taking home that top prize. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve and a burning desire to prove myself. Bring it on, I'm ready to take the datathon by storm! Hey there! I'm Isabella, a third-year student with a hunger for code and a drive to win. In my free time, I geek out over web development, devops, and lifehacks. My passion for innovative solutions has led me to explore computer vision, blockchain, and more. Having already hacked my way to success in one hackathon, I'm not here to make friends or learn for the sake of learning - I'm all about taking that top prize. Bring on the challenges, and I'll be ready to unleash my coding prowess and take the datathon by storm!
