Hey, I'm Ava! For this datathon, my main objective is to take home the win. I've got a competitive streak and love the rush of adrenaline that comes with giving it my all. I've participated in 4 hackathons before and know what it takes to craft a killer project. I'm here to focus on building something innovative, testing my skills, and showing everyone what I'm made of. I'm all about giving it my best shot, learning from the experience, and hopefully claiming that top spot on the podium! Hey there! I'm Ava Thompson, a third-year student with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I've had a solid foundation in programming, and now I'm all about taking my skills to the next level. I thrive under pressure and love the fast-paced environment of hackathons. My friends would say I'm competitive, driven, and always up for a challenge. I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm and expertise to this datathon and see what kind of innovative solution I can come up with. Let's do this!
