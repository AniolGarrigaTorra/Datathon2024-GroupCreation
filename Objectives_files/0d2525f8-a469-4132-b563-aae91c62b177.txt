Hey! As I strap up my coding skills for this datathon, my primary goal is clear: I'm in it to win it. I want to take home that top prize and prove to myself that all the late-night coding sessions and endless hours of problem-solving have been worth it. I'm eager to dive head-first into the challenges and put my skills to the test. I'm confident that with my experience from previous hackathons and my burning desire to win, I have what it takes to emerge victorious. See you on the leaderboard! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a Flynn, a driven 18-year-old student with a passion for coding and a love for competition. When I'm not juggling school and coding challenges, I'm always looking for the next thrill. That's why I'm so stoked to be here for this datathon! With a solid foundation in programming and a dash of creativity, I'm confident that I can tackle even the toughest challenges. So, let's get this coding party started and see where the night takes us!
