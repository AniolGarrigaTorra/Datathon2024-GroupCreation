I'm coming for the win! My goal is to be crowned the champion of this datathon. I've participated in one hackathon before and didn't even make it to the top three, but I'm not gonna let that discourage me. I've been training hard and I'm eager to put my skills to the test. I'm aiming to be one of the top teams and take home the prize. I'll be pouring all my energy into understanding the challenges and solving them as efficiently as possible. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Núria Soriano García, a 20-year-old student and aspiring tech whiz. I've had a taste of hackathons before, and I'm itching to try again. This time, I'm setting my sights on winning. I've been honing my skills and training hard to be ready for whatever challenges come our way. I'm excited to tackle problems, innovate, and collaborate with my teammates. With my passion for tech and my willingness to learn, I'm confident we'll make a winning combination. Bring on the datathon - I'm ready to give it my all!
