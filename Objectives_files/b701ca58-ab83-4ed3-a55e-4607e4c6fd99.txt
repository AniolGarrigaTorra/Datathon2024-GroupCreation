My goal for this datathon is to come out with new skills and knowledge that I can apply to my studies. As a 1st-year student, I'm still getting the hang of programming and I'm excited to dive into more advanced topics. I'm looking forward to learning from others, getting feedback on my projects, and exploring new tools and techniques. I'm not too worried about winning or losing, just about taking away valuable experiences and insights that will help me grow as a developer. Hey there! I'm SÃ­lvia, an 18-year-old student trying to navigate the world of coding. I'm in my first year, and I'm still learning the ropes. I'm excited to join this datathon and challenge myself to learn something new. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of technology and problem-solving. I love tinkering with languages like TypeScript and Rust, and I've had some experience with React. I'm hoping to gain a deeper understanding of programming and make new connections with like-minded folks. Let's take on this datathon together and see what cool stuff we can come up with!
