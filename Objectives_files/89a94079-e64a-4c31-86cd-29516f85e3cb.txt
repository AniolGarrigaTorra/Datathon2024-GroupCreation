I'm all about crushing it this datathon! My goal is to win, plain and simple. I'm a total competitor at heart and I'm not satisfied with anything less than first place. I've been preparing for weeks, studying algorithms and practicing coding challenges. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to put in the long hours and give it my all. I'm not interested in just participating or having a good time (although those are important too, I'm sure!) - my sights are set on taking home the top prize. Hey everyone! I'm Alessia, a first-year student with a passion for building innovative solutions that make a difference. I've been getting my feet wet in the coding world and I'm excited to put my skills to the test at this datathon. I'm a go-getter who thrives on competition, so I'm setting my sights on taking home the top prize. Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the intersection of tech and social good. I'm all about leveling up and I'm ready to collaborate and learn from an amazing team - let's crush it together!
