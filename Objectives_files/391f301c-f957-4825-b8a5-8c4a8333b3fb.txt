Hey! I'm Sofía, and for this datathon, my goal is to have a blast and make the most of it! I'm really excited to meet new people, learn from them, and share some laughs together. I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, try my hand at some new skills, and maybe even find some new buddies who share my passion for coding. I'm not too fussed about winning - I just want to enjoy the ride, be creative, and make some unforgettable memories with my new friends! Bring on the fun! Hey there!
