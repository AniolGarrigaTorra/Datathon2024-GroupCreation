Hey, I'm Ashley! I'm really looking forward to this datathon! My goal is to make the most of this experience and have a blast while doing it. I want to meet new people, learn from others, and participate in as many events as possible. I'm all about building connections and memories, rather than competing for the top prize. I'm excited to collaborate with others, explore different projects, and take away valuable insights from the expert speakers. And, of course, let's not forget about the after-parties and team-building activities! It's going to be an awesome weekend! Hey, I'm Ashley!
