As I gear up for this datathon, I'm all about giving it my all and going for the win! My objective is to crush it, literally. I'm here to push my coding skills to the limit, solve the challenges with lightning speed, and ultimately emerge on top of the leaderboard. I'm not looking to waste any time socializing (not that that's a bad thing!), I'm solely focused on winning and taking home the gold. So, expect me to be heads-down, coding up a storm, and ready to give it my all to take the top spot! Hey there! I'm Odette Langley, a 2nd-year student taking on the datathon with a winning mindset. When it comes to programming, I've got a passion for building innovative solutions that make a difference. With a focus on the tech giants of the future - think AR and VR - I'm always looking for ways to push my coding limits. For this datathon, I'm putting all my energy into giving it my all and taking home the top spot. So, expect to see me fueled and focused, determined to deliver the goods.
