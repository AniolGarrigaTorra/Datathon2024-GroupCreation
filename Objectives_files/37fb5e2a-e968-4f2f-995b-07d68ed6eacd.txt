Hi there! I'm Aurélien, nice to meet you! For this datathon, I'm all about making connections and having a blast. I'm not really here to compete and crush everyone else (although I do love a good challenge!). I'm looking to learn, but mainly from chatting with my fellow participants and getting tips and tricks from them. My main goal is to make as many new friends as possible and have a heap of fun doing it. I want to participate in as many events as I can, whether it's a workshop or a dance party. Just bring the good vibes and let's get this datathon started! Hey there! I'm Aurélien, a third-year student just trying to make the most of this datathon experience. I'm not super competitive, I just want to connect with fellow hackers, learn from each other's projects, and soak up all the good vibes this event has to offer. By day, I'm a tech enthusiast experimenting with code; by night, I'm a design lover exploring the intersection of art and programming. I'm all about solving real-world problems, especially in healthcare and e-commerce. Ready to make some new friends and have a blast, anyone up for it?
