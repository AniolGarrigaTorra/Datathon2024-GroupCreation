I'm super excited to take part in this datathon and I'm focusing on improving my skills above all. As an intermediate coder, I want to learn from the best, experiment with new tech and stretch my coding muscles. I'd love to dive deep into machine learning and data analysis, and learn from the expert talks and workshops. I'm all about taking my programming to the next level, so I'm prioritizing learning and skill-building over winning. Can't wait to soak up all the knowledge and take home some new tricks to rock in my next project! Hey everyone! I'm Sof√≠a Leonhart, a third-year student eager to dive into the world of datathon. With a passion for programming, I'm looking to level up my coding skills and learn from the experts. I've been hooked on developing mobile apps and exploring the wonders of machine learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over the latest game or IoT gadget. I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon and can't wait to meet like-minded enthusiasts. Let's make some amazing projects together!
