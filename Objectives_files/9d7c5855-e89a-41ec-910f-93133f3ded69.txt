My objective for this datathon is to take the crown and come out on top. I'm all about pushing myself to the limit and leaving everything on the table. I've participated in a couple of hackathons in the past and I know what it takes to win - a solid team, clever coding, and a whole lot of determination. I'm here to learn new skills and improve my programming abilities, but let's be real, my number one goal is to take home that top prize and bask in the glory of being the best. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Lucas, a 19-year-old college freshman with a passion for innovation. I've always been drawn to technology's potential to make a real impact. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me coding away or exploring new ways to apply AR/VR to improve daily life. I've got a fire in my belly to win this datathon and show the world what I'm capable of. With a drive to succeed and a willingness to learn, I'm ready to take on the challenge and prove myself as a force to be reckoned with!
