Hey there! So, for this datathon, I'm all about having a blast and making some new connections. I don't really care about competing to win (this time around, at least). I just wanna have fun, attend as many events as I can, and learn from the experience. I'm hoping to meet fellow data enthusiasts, grab some snacks and laughs with them, and just enjoy the atmosphere. Plus, who knows, maybe I'll even stumble upon some cool tools and techniques to improve my skills a bit too. Let's just say I'm all about chill vibes and socializing at this datathon! Hey everyone! I'm Soledad, a 17-year-old coding newbie just starting my university journey. I'm super passionate about using tech to make a positive impact and love learning about the latest innovation trends. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new programming languages, reading about lifehacks and cybersecurity, and exploring the world of fintech and e-commerce. I'm super excited to be here and meet fellow data enthusiasts who share my enthusiasm for coding and creativity. Can't wait to chill, learn, and make some new friends!
