I'm excited to join this datathon with an open mind and a hungry appetite for adventure! My objective is to make the most of this experience by surrounding myself with like-minded people, having a blast, and trying out as many new things as possible. I'm looking forward to taking part in hackathons, attending workshops, and participating in team-building activities. My goal is to come away from this weekend with new friendships, a wealth of knowledge, and some unforgettable memories. Let's get this party started! Hey everyone! I'm Meritxell, a 21-year-old computer science student with a taste for adventure and a passion for problem-solving. I'm always up for a challenge and thrive in collaborative environments. I'm excited to join this datathon and learn from the best in the field. As a beginner-turned-intermediate programmer, I'm eager to dive into new technologies and explore their potential to make a difference. I'm looking forward to meeting like-minded individuals, attending workshops, and pushing the limits of innovation. Let's hack, learn, and have some fun together!
