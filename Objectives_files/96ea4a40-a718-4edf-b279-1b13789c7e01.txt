I'm Audrey, and I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My objective is to have an absolute blast and make as many new friends as I can. I'd love to be part of a cool team, learn from others, and just enjoy the experience. I'm not too focused on winning (I'm still a programming newbie after all!) but rather on soaking up knowledge, trying new things, and sharing laughs with fellow participants. Bring on the puzzles, challenges, and social events - I'm ready to dive in and have the time of my life! Hey there! I'm Audrey, a first-year student with a passion for trying new things. I've got a bit of a creative streak and love combining communication, design, and gaming to make something cool. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the latest video games or binge-watching my favorite shows. I'm excited to join the datathon and see what kind of adventures await me. I'm a total newbie when it comes to coding, so I'm looking forward to learning and sharing laughs with fellow participants. Let's do this!
