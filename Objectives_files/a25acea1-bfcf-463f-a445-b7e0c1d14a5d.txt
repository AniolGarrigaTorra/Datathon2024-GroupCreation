Hey! As a 21-year-old student with a competitive streak, my objective for this datathon is crystal clear: I'm all about winning. I'm tired of being close, but not quite taking the top spot, and I'm ready to bring my A-game. I've already done two hackathons, and I know I've got the skills to take it to the next level. I'm pumped to dig into the data, get my coding hat on, and prove to myself that I've got what it takes to win. Let the competition begin! Hey there! I'm Aurora, a third-year student with a passion for solving complex problems and a competitive edge. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm tinkering with code, designing innovative products, or exploring the latest tech trends. For me, this datathon is all about showcasing my skills and taking home the top prize. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm all about refinement and attention to detail. With my sights set on victory, I'm ready to dive into the challenge and show what I'm made of!
