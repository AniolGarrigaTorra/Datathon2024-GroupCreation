Hey! So, I'm super stoked to be a part of this datathon! My objective is to soak up the experience and have an absolute blast! I'm all about making new friends, having fun, and participating in as many events as possible. I'm not too concerned about being the top dog, I just want to enjoy the ride, learn from others, and be part of an amazing community. I'm sure to get a ton out of this event and make some unforgettable memories. Bring it on! Hey everyone! I'm Leonhard, a 19-year-old student from the heart of innovation. I'm all about crafting meaningful experiences and making a difference. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me exploring the intersection of tech and design. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon and can't wait to geek out with fellow coders and makers. I'm super chill, all about collaboration, and up for a fun challenge! Let's crush this datathon together and create something amazing.
