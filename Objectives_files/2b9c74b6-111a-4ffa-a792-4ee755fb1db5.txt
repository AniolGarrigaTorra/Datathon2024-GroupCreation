Hey there! I'm Sophia, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon. For me, it's all about the vibes - I'm here to make new friends, have a blast, and get my learn on without stressing too much about the competition. I've been to a few hackathons before, and I know how exhilarating it is to be part of a community that's passionate about tech and innovation. My goal is to soak up as much knowledge as I can, try new things, and make some amazing connections along the way! Hey there! I'm Sophia, a 20-year-old undergrad student who's stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm all about embracing innovative ideas and making a positive impact, and this event is the perfect platform to do so. I've had my fair share of hackathons and love the electric vibe that comes with collaborating with like-minded individuals. When I'm not coding, you can find me looking for lifehacks to streamline my daily routine. I'm looking forward to an amazing 24 hours of learning, creativity, and camaraderie!
