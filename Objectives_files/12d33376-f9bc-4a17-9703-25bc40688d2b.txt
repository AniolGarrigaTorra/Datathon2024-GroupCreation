My objective is simple - I want to have a blast and make new friends! I'm not really trying to win or focus on getting the best hack, I just want to learn new things, soak up the vibe, and participate in as many events as I can. I love the energy of hackathons and datathons, and I'm all about making memories and meeting like-minded people. I'm all about being relaxed and having fun - whether that means trying out new tech, jamming to music, or just geeking out with fellow competitors! Hey there! I'm Sakshi, a 20-year-old university student with a passion for exploring the tech world. I've dived into a bit of programming in my free time and have a love for solving real-world problems through coding. I'm really looking forward to experiencing the datathon energy and meeting fellow like-minded people. When I'm not geeking out with code, you can find me indulging in some amazing tunes or getting lost in some binge-watching session. My motto is to always have fun and learn something new, so buckle up and let's rock this datathon!
