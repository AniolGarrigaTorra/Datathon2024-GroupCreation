As I dive into this datathon, my top priority is to immerse myself in new tech and learning experiences. I want to challenge myself, take on new concepts, and push my skills to the next level. My goal is to step outside my comfort zone, experiment with novel approaches, and develop a deeper understanding of the latest trends in data science. By embracing this opportunity, I aim to improve my programming skills, stay ahead of the curve, and become a more confident problem-solver. It's time to level up and expand my toolkit! Hey! I'm Luna, a 21-year-old university student diving into my third year of studies. I'm excited to join this datathon, eager to shake off my comfort zone and push my skills to new heights. As a curious learner, I thrive in environments that challenge me and fuel my passion for problem-solving. Music and art have always been my escape, but I'm driven by the tech world's ever-changing landscape. My focus is on expanding my programming skills and staying ahead of the curve. Ready to jam, learn, and grow - let's get this datathon started!
