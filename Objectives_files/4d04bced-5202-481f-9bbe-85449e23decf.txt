My goal for this datathon is to challenge myself and dive deeper into the world of data science. I'm really excited to learn new techniques and algorithms, and gain hands-on experience with different tools and technologies. I'm looking forward to tackling interesting projects and working with fellow participants to learn from each other's strengths and experiences. Ultimately, I hope to come out of this datathon with a new skillset, a fresh perspective, and a stronger foundation in data analysis to support my career in programming. Hi everyone! I'm Leticia, a 20-year-old student with a passion for combining my love of gaming and technology. As a 3rd-year student, I've been fascinated by the world of data science and its endless possibilities. I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon to challenge myself and dive deeper into data analysis. I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and learning from their experiences. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with various programming languages and tools, and I'm always eager to apply them to real-world projects. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
