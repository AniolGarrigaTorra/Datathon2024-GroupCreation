Hey there! So, I'm Sofia, and I'm really excited to be participating in this datathon! For me, it's all about making new friends, having a blast, and taking part in as many events as I can. I'm not too stressed about the competition aspect - I just want to immerse myself in the atmosphere, learn some new tricks, and maybe even pick up some fresh inspiration. My main goal is to enjoy the experience and make memories with fellow participants. I'm looking forward to laughing, networking, and getting creative! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 22-year-old student with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. When I'm not in class, you can find me experimenting with music or art, trying to create something new and exciting. I love solving puzzles and playing with code, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow. I'm thrilled to be participating in this datathon and can't wait to connect with fellow participants, learn from their experiences, and maybe even discover some fresh inspiration for my own projects!
