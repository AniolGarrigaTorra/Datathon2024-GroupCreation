My goal for this datathon is to come out on top - plain and simple. I've participated in three hackathons before, and I've always come close to winning but didn't quite seal the deal. I'm determined to use my skills to create something innovative and impressive, and I'm not leaving until I get that win. I've been prepping for weeks, and I know my coding game is strong. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Sofia! I'm a 19-year-old student with a passion for programming and a drive to win. I've been hooking up with computers since I was a teen, and I've honed my coding skills through countless late nights and caffeine-fueled marathons. This is my fourth hackathon, and I'm more determined than ever to take home the gold. My friends say I'm a perfectionist, and they're not wrong. When I set my sights on something, I don't rest until I get it just right. Bring it on, and let's see if my persistence pays off!
