Hey! So I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon, and my objective is pretty simple - I want to have a blast! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, making friends, and learning together. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I've always ended up feeling overwhelmed and stressing too much about winning. This time, I want to take a step back, enjoy the experience, and participate in as many events as possible. Whether it's a workshop, a breakout session, or just a casual chat over coffee, I'm looking forward to making memories and expanding my network. Hey there! I'm Sofia Elena Rivera, a 20-year-old student excited to be a part of this datathon. I'm all about communication, so I love bringing people together and making new connections. When it comes to programming, I'm more of a laid-back learner who enjoys the process of discovery. In my free time, I tinker with IoT projects and try to automate stuff, which I find super rewarding. I'm looking forward to taking it easy this time around and just soaking up the vibes with my fellow participants!
