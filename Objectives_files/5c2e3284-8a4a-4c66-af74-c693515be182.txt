For me, datathon is an opportunity to grow and learn from scratch. I'm not looking to win at all costs, but rather to challenge myself to grasp new concepts and techniques in programming. My objective is to walk away with tangible skills and knowledge that'll help me take my coding game to the next level. I'm eager to dive into real-world problems, collaborate with fellow participants, and absorb as much information as possible. Hey there! I'm Rebecca, a 17-year-old student and coding newbie. I'm stoked to be here for the datathon, eager to level up my programming skills and learn from scratch. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm all about the process and seeing where it takes me. I've always been fascinated by the possibilities of AI and ML, and I'm excited to dive into real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the world of art and music. Let's get creative and have some fun!
