Hey, I'm all about making this datathon an awesome experience! I'm really looking forward to meeting new people and making friends who share similar passions. I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, learn some new skills, and have an amazing time doing it. Don't get me wrong, winning would be sick, but at the end of the day, I'm here to have fun, soak up as much knowledge as I can, and expand my network. I'm all about vibing with the datathon community and making some unforgettable memories! Hey everyone! I'm Aurora Vidal, and I'm stoked to be here for the datathon! I'm a 2nd-year student who's all about tech and innovation. I've got a passion for learning and growth, and I'm always on the lookout for like-minded people to share experiences with. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me jamming out to music or creating art. My aim for this datathon is to make unforgettable memories with my fellow participants, and to walk away with some new skills and perspectives under my belt. Looking forward to vibing with all of you!
