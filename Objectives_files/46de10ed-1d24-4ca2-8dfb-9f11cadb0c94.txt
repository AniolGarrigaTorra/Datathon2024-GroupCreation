Hi! So, my goal for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win! I've been preparing for weeks, brushing up on my Python skills and getting familiar with the tools and technologies used. I'm all about the adrenaline rush of creating something innovative and presenting it to the judges. I'll put in the extra hours, collaborate with my teammates, and do whatever it takes to make our project stand out from the rest. My dream is to take home that top spot and show everyone what I'm capable of! Hey! I'm Anna Klein, a 2nd-year student with a passion for creating positive change through technology. I'm excited to participate in this datathon, pushing my skills to the limit to develop an innovative solution. With a background in programming and experience with Agile methodology, I'm comfortable with the fast-paced nature of this competition. My goal is to create something remarkable and present it to the judges. I thrive under pressure, love the adrenaline rush of ideation, and am always up for a challenge. Bring it on!
