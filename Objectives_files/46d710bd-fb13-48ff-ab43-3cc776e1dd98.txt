Hey! My goal for this datathon is to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone. With my intermediate level of programming experience, I'm eager to dive into new tools, languages, and techniques. I'm hoping to learn from fellow participants, mentors, and sessions, and apply what I learn to improve my coding skills. I'm looking forward to solving complex problems, getting feedback, and refining my skills. Ultimately, I want to take away new skills, fresh ideas, and a renewed sense of confidence in my abilities. Hey! I'm Sandra, a 19-year-old student looking to shake things up at this datathon. I've been coding for a bit, and I'm ready to challenge myself and push beyond my comfort zone. I'm all about innovation, whether it's lifehacks, new tech, or social good. I love learning and being part of a community that's just as passionate about problem-solving. I'm excited to learn from others, get feedback, and take away some fresh ideas and new skills. Looking forward to this adventure and seeing what we can create together!
