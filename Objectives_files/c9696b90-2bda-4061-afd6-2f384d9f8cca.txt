Hey there! So, my objective for this datathon is pretty straightforward - I want to level up my data skills and learn as much as I can from this experience. I'm still relatively new to programming and this event is the perfect opportunity for me to dive deeper into data analysis and visualization. I'm hoping to take away new knowledge, refine my skills, and maybe even get some inspiration for future projects. No pressure, no competition, just pure learning and skill-building - that's my aim! Hey! I'm Eva, a 20-year-old student on a mission to master data skills. I've got a passion for design and creativity, but I'm still figuring out where my programming skills fit in. I've dabbled in Flask and Android development, and I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis and visualization. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to learn, grow, and maybe even spark some inspiration for future projects. I'm all about hands-on learning, collaboration, and having fun. Can't wait to meet my fellow data enthusiasts and crush some coding challenges together!
