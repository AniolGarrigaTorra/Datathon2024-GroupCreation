My objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I'm all about self-improvement, and I think datathons are an amazing opportunity to stretch my coding muscles and get feedback from industry experts. I'm hoping to tackle new languages, learn from other participants, and experiment with new tools and techniques. My goal is to come out of this event feeling more confident in my abilities and excited to take on new projects. I'm all about growth, not just winning! Hi! I'm Aurora, a 21-year-old student on a mission to constantly improve myself. I'm fascinated by how technology can make a positive impact, especially in education and productivity. I've been dabbling in programming for a few years and I'm loving the challenge of learning something new every day. My goal for this datathon is to stretch my coding skills, learn from others, and maybe even stumble upon a new passion. I'm not a competition junkie, but I do love the energy and inspiration that comes with being around like-minded people. Let's crush this datathon together!
