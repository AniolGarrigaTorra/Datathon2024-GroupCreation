Here's my objective: I'm stoked to be at this datathon! I'm all about having a blast, making new friends, and participating in as many events as possible. I'm not looking to sweat the small stuff about competition or trying to win. I just want to soak up as much knowledge as I can, attend some cool talks, and geek out with like-minded people. If I happen to win something, that's a bonus! My main goal is to have fun and make the most of this experience. Who knows, maybe I'll even discover a new passion! Hey there! I'm Aurora, a second-year student with a thirst for adventure and a passion for geeking out with like-minded people. I'm all about trying new things and learning as much as I can, and I'm super stoked to be at this datathon! I love music, art, and design, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to integrate those interests into my tech pursuits. I'm just here to have a blast, make some new friends, and learn as much as I can - and if I happen to win something along the way, that's just the icing on the cake!
