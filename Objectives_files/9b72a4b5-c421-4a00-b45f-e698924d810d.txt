For me, datathon is all about having a blast and broadening my social circle. I'm not super competitive, and to be honest, I'm more interested in meeting fellow coding enthusiasts and having fun than actually winning first place. I want to attend as many events and workshops as possible, learn some new skills and techniques, and just enjoy the experience. I'm hoping to make some amazing connections and friends along the way, and maybe even discover some hidden talents of my own! Let the datathon vibes begin! Hi! I'm Ariadna, a 18-year-old student diving into my second year of uni. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon adventure! I've got a moderate amount of programming experience under my belt, and I'm all about experimenting with new tech to make something cool happen. When I'm not coding, you can catch me jamming to video games or chatting with friends. For me, this datathon is about having a blast, meeting fellow code enthusiasts, and maybe discovering some new hidden talents. Let's make some awesome connections and create something epic together!
