I'm excited to join this datathon with an objective to take my programming skills to the next level. With only a few hackathons under my belt, I know there's still so much for me to learn. During this datathon, I want to dive deep into specific tools and technologies, challenge myself with new projects, and get feedback from experienced mentors. I'm looking to fill in knowledge gaps and develop a stronger skill set, so I can tackle more complex projects in my future studies. I'm thrilled to be surrounded by like-minded folks who share my passion for learning! Hey everyone! I'm Katja, a 22-year-old student excited to join this datathon. I'm currently in my fourth year of studies and have a decent grasp of programming, but I know there's still so much to learn and discover. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or messing around with new tools and technologies. I'm here to take my skills to the next level, challenge myself, and soak up feedback from experienced mentors. Looking forward to tackling exciting projects and connecting with fellow learners! Let's crush this datathon!
