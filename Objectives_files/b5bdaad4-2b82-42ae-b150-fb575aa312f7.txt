Hey! I'm Lucia, and for this datathon, my goal is to have an amazing time, meet new people, and just go with the flow! I'm not too concerned about winning - I just want to soak up all the knowledge and experiences I can get, make some awesome friends, and enjoy every minute of it. I'm all about that datathon-vibe! I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, from workshops to competitions, and just hang out with fellow datathoners. It's gonna be lit! Hi! I'm Lucia, a curious and ambitious student who's passionate about harnessing technology for social good. I'm a bit of a people person, always looking for opportunities to meet new friends and collaborators. With a background in education and a fascination with IoT, I'm drawn to the intersection of technology and real-world problems. For this datathon, I'm more excited about the journey than the prize, and I'm eager to soak up new skills and experiences alongside fellow datathoners. Let's make some magic happen!
