My goal for this datathon is to really dive deep and learn as much as I can from others and from the challenges. As a student with a solid foundation in programming, I'm looking to take my skills to the next level and broaden my expertise in machine learning and data visualization. I'm hoping to work on projects that push me out of my comfort zone and help me develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I'm all about continuous learning and growth, and I think this datathon is the perfect place to achieve that! Hi everyone! I'm Paloma, a 22-year-old student who's passionate about technology and lifelong learning. I've been programming for a few years now, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level. I'm looking forward to exploring new areas of machine learning and data visualization, as well as pushing myself out of my comfort zone. As an enthusiast of AI and data analysis, I'm eager to work on projects that challenge me and help me grow. I believe that collaboration and mutual growth are essential, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon community!
