My objective for this datathon is clear: to give it my all and come out on top. I've been to a few hackathons before, and I'm confident in my skills, but I know this one is going to be tougher. I want to win, not just participate. I'll be putting in long hours, perfecting my code, and pushing myself to stay ahead of the game. Bring it on! Hey there, I'm Rita Silva! I'm a 20-year-old student and a hackathon regular. I'm all about staying ahead of the curve, whether that's exploring new tech trends or perfecting my coding skills. With a background in design and a passion for problem-solving, I thrive in high-pressure environments where creative thinking meets technical know-how. I'm looking forward to diving into this datathon and pushing myself to be the best I can be. Bring on the challenge!
