My objective for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and not just stick to the coding part. I want to meet fellow data enthusiasts, learn from them, and have a blast with my new friends! I'm excited to participate in the jam sessions, workshops, and networking activities, and of course, take part in as many hack challenges as I can. My goal is to walk away with amazing memories, new friendships, and a smile on my face - and maybe, just maybe, discover a hidden talent or two! Hey everyone! I'm Ava, a 20-year-old student with a passion for building things and making connections. As an aspiring data wizard, I'm all about exploring the wonders of data and bringing people together to share knowledge. In my free time, you can find me hacking away at my gaming setup or designing my next big thing in Figma. I'm all about balancing fun and function, and I think this datathon is going to be the perfect blend of both. I'm super stoked to meet fellow data enthusiasts, learn from each other, and have an amazing time along the way!
