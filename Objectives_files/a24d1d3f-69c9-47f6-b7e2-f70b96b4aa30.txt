Hi! As Ava Rivera, I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to learn as much as I can and improve my programming skills. I'm a 17-year-old freshman with limited experience in the field, but I'm eager to learn from the best and expand my knowledge. I'd love to absorb insights from the experts, learn new tools and techniques, and refine my skills. My goal is to walk out of this event with a newfound confidence and a stronger foundation to build on, so I can rock my subsequent projects and hackathons! Hi everyone! I'm Ava, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! I'm just a first-year student, but I'm eager to learn and improve my skills. I've dabbled in programming for a bit and have a thing for quantum mechanics and databases. When I'm not stuck in my textbooks, I love to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in IoT and communication tech. I'm here to soak up knowledge from the best and get some valuable feedback to help me become a better coder. Let's make this weekend an amazing learning experience!
