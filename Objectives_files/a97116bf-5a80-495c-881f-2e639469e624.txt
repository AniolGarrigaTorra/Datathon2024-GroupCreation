I'm Alexandra, and I'm all about vibes and networking at this datathon! My objective is to soak up the experience and create lasting connections with fellow data enthusiasts. I want to attend as many events as possible, learn from the industry experts, and participate in workshops that will help me improve my skills while having a blast. I'm not too fussed about winning - I'm all about making memories and sharing this incredible experience with like-minded folks. Expect me to be the friendly face with a constant smile and an open mind! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a 21-year-old fourth-year student with a passion for technology.
