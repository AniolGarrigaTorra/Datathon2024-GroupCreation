My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm all about making new friends and having an awesome time! I've done 5 hackathons before, so I'm looking to shake things up and try new things. I'm excited to attend various events, workshops, and meetups, and just soak up as much as I can. Winning isn't the top priority for me - I'm more about creating unforgettable memories with like-minded people and improving my skills in a fun and relaxed environment. Bring on the networking, hack sessions, and crazy dance parties! Hey there! I'm Marta Vall√©s, an 18-year-old student eager to dive into the datathon scene. With a passion for communication and making meaningful connections, I'm excited to meet like-minded people and learn from each other. I've had a taste of hackathons before, and I'm ready to take on new challenges and experiences. I believe that fun and collaboration are just as important as coding skills, so I'm all about creating unforgettable memories and improving my skills in a relaxed environment. Let's make this datathon a blast!
