Hey there! I'm Anaís, and I'm all about being competitive. For this datathon, my objective is to leave it all out there and give it my best shot to win. I'm not looking to just participate - I'm looking to outdo everyone else. With my 9 hackathon credits under my belt and a solid grasp of programming skills, I'm feeling confident. I'll be diving headfirst into the challenges, determined to learn from others and improve my craft. The ultimate goal is that shiny prize, and I won't stop until I claim it. Hey there! I'm Anaís, and I'm super pumped to be part of this datathon. As a third-year student, I've got a solid foundation in programming and a proven track record of crushing it in hackathons (9 under my belt, to be exact!). My competitive streak is in full swing, and I'm all about giving it my all to take the top spot. By day, I'm a student, and by night, I'm a musician and artist (because creativity's gotta stay in check, you know?). Can't wait to dive in and bring home that shiny prize!
