Hey there! As Ava Monroe, I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon. My main goal is to learn as much as I can and level up my programming skills. I'm looking to gain hands-on experience with new tools and techniques, and learn from the insights and expertise of the other participants. I'm excited to challenge myself and take on new problems, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone. By the end of this datathon, I'm hoping to walk away with new skills, a fresh perspective, and a sense of accomplishment. Let's get coding! Hey everyone! I'm Ava Monroe, a curious and creative 18-year-old studying in my 2nd year. When I'm not hitting the books, I love experimenting with new tech to create innovative experiences. I've had a taste of programming and want to level up my skills through this datathon. I'm all about exploring the intersection of technology and art, and I'm excited to challenge myself and learn from others. Let's grab this opportunity and take our skills to the next level!
