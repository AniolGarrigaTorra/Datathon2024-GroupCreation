I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! My objective is to have an absolute blast and meet new friends. I want to participate in as many events and activities as I can, and just soak up the energy and excitement. I'm more about vibing with fellow participants than being super competitive or focused on winning. I'm down for teaming up, sharing knowledge, and learning new things together. Let's build some amazing connections and create unforgettable memories! Hey, I'm River! I'm a 20-year-old student just diving into the world of coding and tech. I'm all about exploring how tech can make a positive impact on people's lives. When I'm not buried in books, I love getting creative with design and trying new things. I'm super passionate about building connections and learning from others. I'm stoked to be here, and I'm looking forward to vibing with all of you and creating some amazing memories together!
