My goal for this datathon is to bring home the gold. I've participated in one hackathon before and while I had a blast, I was a little too focused on learning and wasn't able to tap into my competitive spirit. This time, I'm all about winning. I've got a solid foundation in programming and I'm ready to show off my skills. I'm not just looking to take part, I'm looking to take the top prize. I'll be putting in the long hours, collaborating with my team, and pushing myself to the limit to achieve victory. Hey there, I'm Emily Welles, a 20-year-old student with a passion for competitive coding. I've got a strong foundation in programming and I'm looking to put it to the test in this datathon. I've previously participated in a hackathon, but this time, I'm all about winning. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to my favorite tunes or geeking out over the latest art trends. My goal is to push myself to the limit and take home the top prize. Let's get this datathon started!
