Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to make new connections, have a blast, and take part in as many fun events as possible! I've got the basics of programming down, but I'm all about networking and learning from others. I'd love to collaborate with fellow coders, learn about new tech trends, and enjoy some yummy food and good vibes with the crew. Don't get me wrong, I'll definitely put my skills to the test, but my main goal is to soak up the datathon atmosphere and make unforgettable memories with the gang! Hey there! I'm Alessia Rose, a 22-year-old student and coding enthusiast. I'm all about learning and growth, especially when it comes to Fintech, Enterprise, and all things tech. With a solid foundation in programming, I'm excited to dive into the datathon and collaborate with fellow coders. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me networking, exploring new tech trends, or simply enjoying the company of like-minded individuals. My goal is to soak up the atmosphere, learn from others, and make unforgettable memories with the gang! Can't wait to get this datathon started!
