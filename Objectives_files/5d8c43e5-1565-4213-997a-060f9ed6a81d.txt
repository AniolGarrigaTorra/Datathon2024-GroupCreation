Hey, I'm Rylan. I'm all about winning, to be honest. I've participated in two hackathons and I've come close to the top spots, but I'm not satisfied with anything less than first place. I've been studying programming for years and I know I have the skills to take on the best. At this datathon, I'm looking to dominate, to crunch those numbers and crack those codes. I want to outdo everyone and take home that top prize. Bring it on, I'm ready for a fight! Hey there! I'm Rylan, a 19-year-old software enthusiast. When I'm not hitting the books, I love to dive into code and push myself to the limit. Two hackathons under my belt, and I'm not done yet. I'm driven by a desire to win and improve with every challenge. With a passion for data science and a knack for problem-solving, I'm all about using my skills to make a difference. At the datathon, you can expect me to bring my A-game - I'm ready to tackle the toughest questions and prove myself among the best.
