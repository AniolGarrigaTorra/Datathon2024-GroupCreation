As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to take part in this datathon! My objective is to dive headfirst into the world of data exploration and learning. I'm looking to expand my skillset and fill the gaps in my current knowledge, so I'm hoping to gain insights into emerging trends, techniques, and tools. I'm not about winning the top prize - I'm all about leveling up my game, improving my coding chops, and walking away with new experiences and perspectives. Can't wait to absorb as much as I can and contribute to the datathon's vibrant community! Hey there! I'm Evelyn, a 21-year-old student and data enthusiast. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes or scribbling art in my sketchbook. I'm excited to be here at the datathon because I'm all about leveling up my skills and learning from others. I've got a solid foundation in programming, but I know there's always more to learn. I'm looking forward to diving into new trends, techniques, and tools, and I'm stoked to be part of such a vibrant community! Let's get this data party started!
