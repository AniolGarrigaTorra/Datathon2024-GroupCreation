Here's my brief objective for the datathon:

As a participant, I aim to leverage this datathon as an opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge in data analysis and programming. I'm excited to dive into new tools and techniques, take on new challenges, and learn from others in the field. My primary goal is to grow as a data professional, stay updated with the latest trends and technologies, and be challenged to step out of my comfort zone. I'm looking forward to making meaningful connections and networking with fellow data enthusiasts along the way! Hey there! I'm Maria Elena Carson, a 21-year-old student passionate about using tech to make a difference. I'm a 3rd-year undergrad with a foundation in programming and a thirst for learning. When I'm not crunching code, you can find me jamming out to music or whipping up a new design project. I'm stoked to be here at the datathon, eager to level up my data analysis skills and connect with like-minded peeps. Let's get creative and kick some digital butt together!
