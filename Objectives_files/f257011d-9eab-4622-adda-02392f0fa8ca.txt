I'm Mariona, and I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My objective is to dive headfirst into this challenge and level up my skills. I've been doing hackathons for a few years now, and I'm looking forward to putting my knowledge to the test. I want to learn new things, experiment with different tools, and refine my programming skills. I'm open to trying new approaches and approaches, and I'm hoping to come out of this with some sweet new techniques and a bunch of fun projects to add to my portfolio. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Mariona, a 20-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me coding away or exploring new tech trends. I've participated in a few hackathons, and I'm always up for a challenge. My goal is to learn as much as I can, try new things, and maybe even discover some new favorite tools. I'm excited to see what this datathon has in store and can't wait to meet the other participants. Let's make some magic happen!
