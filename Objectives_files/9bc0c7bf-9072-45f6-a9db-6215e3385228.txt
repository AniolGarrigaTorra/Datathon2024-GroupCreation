Hey! So, I'm all about having a blast and making new friends at this datathon! My objective is to not get too caught up in trying to win or stress about perfection. Instead, I'm excited to take it easy, soak up the vibes, and learn alongside others. I'd love to attend workshops, participate in mini-hack sessions, and get to know fellow participants outside of our projects. My goal is to walk away with new pals and a fun experience that I'll look back on with smiles. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lie, a 22-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I'm all about using technology to drive social good and make a positive impact. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to learn from fellow participants, discover new skills, and contribute to some amazing projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to music or experimenting with art. My objective is to have a blast, meet new people, and walk away with a fun experience. Let's get this datathon started!
