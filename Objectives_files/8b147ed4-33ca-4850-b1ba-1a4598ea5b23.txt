My goal for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge as I can and level up my programming skills. I'm excited to dive into new challenges and technologies, and I hope to come out with some shiny new tools to add to my toolkit. I'd love to get feedback from my peers and mentors, and take part in workshops and tutorials to improve my skills. My aim is to learn as much as possible, and to leave this datathon feeling more confident and competent in my abilities. Hi everyone! I'm Am√©lie, a third-year student excited to dive into the datathon. I'm no expert yet, but I'm passionate about learning and leveling up my programming skills. I've had some experience with Android development, data visualization, and tinkering with the cloud. I'm eager to absorb knowledge from workshops, tutorials, and my peers. I'm not looking to win, just to come out feeling more confident and competent. I'm a beginner in the community, but I'm ready to take the leap. I'm looking forward to making new connections and learning from everyone's diverse perspectives. See you all at the datathon!
