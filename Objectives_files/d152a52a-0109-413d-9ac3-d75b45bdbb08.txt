I'm going all in on this datathon - my top priority is to win! With my intermediate programming skills and previous hackathon experience under my belt, I'm confident in my ability to tackle complex challenges and come out on top. I'm looking to improve my coding techniques, learn new skills, and show off my skills against the best of the best. I'm prepared to put in the long hours, brainstorm innovative solutions, and outmaneuver my competitors to claim that top spot. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Ava, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast and aspiring rockstar. I'm in my third year of university, with a hunger for data and a drive to make a name for myself. I've got intermediate-level coding chops, and I've already rocked a hackathon or two. When I'm not typing away at my laptop, you can find me belting out my favorite tunes or sketching out my next artistic endeavor. My goal for this datathon is simple: win it all and show the world what I'm made of! Bring on the challenge!
