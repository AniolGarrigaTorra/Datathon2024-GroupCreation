Hey! So, I'm looking to make some amazing memories at this datathon. My goal is to meet new and like-minded people, have an absolute blast, and take part in as many activities as possible. I'm all about embracing the fun factor, making new friends, and creating an unforgettable experience. I won't worry too much about winning, as I believe that the best way to grow is by being part of a community that's passionate and driven. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Luisa, a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and making new connections. In my free time, you can find me experimenting with coding, playing games, or vibing to some sick tunes. I love the combination of tech and creativity, which led me to my current major in computer science. I'm all about spreading positivity and laughter, and I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon crew! I'm ready to geek out, make memories, and soak up every moment of this awesome experience. Can't wait to meet you and rock this datathon!
