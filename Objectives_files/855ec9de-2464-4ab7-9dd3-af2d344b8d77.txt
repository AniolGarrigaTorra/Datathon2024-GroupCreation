I'm coming to the datathon with an eager mindset, excited to push my boundaries and learn new tricks. My goal is to improve my coding skills, especially with the tech stacks that will be featured during the event. I want to soak up knowledge and expertise from the other participants, mentors, and judges. I'm willing to step out of my comfort zone, take calculated risks, and learn from my mistakes. By the end of the datathon, I hope to have gained a better understanding of what it takes to be a rockstar developer and walk away with new perspectives and fresh ideas. Hey, I'm Alex!
