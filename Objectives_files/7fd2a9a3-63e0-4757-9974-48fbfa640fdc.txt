Hey there! I'm Aurora Winston. For this datathon, my main objective is to soak up as much new knowledge as possible and take my programming skills to the next level. I'm really eager to learn from others, participate in challenging tasks, and experiment with different technologies and approaches. I'm hoping to broaden my perspectives, gain insights from industry experts, and come away with some valuable takeaways that I can apply to my future projects. I'm all about continuous learning and improvement, so this datathon is going to be an amazing opportunity for me to do just that! Hey there! I'm Aurora Winston, a 19-year-old student with a passion for coding and learning. I'm currently in my second year of studies, and I'm excited to be here at the datathon. With a background in UI/UX design and web development, I'm eager to explore new tech trends and expand my skillset. Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with music and art, and playing games.
