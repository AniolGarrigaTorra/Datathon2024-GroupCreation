Hi! My name is Ariel and I'm all about winning. My objective for this datathon is to dominate the competition and take home the top prize. I've participated in three hackathons before, and although I've improved my coding skills, I haven't yet claimed that elusive first-place title. I'm aiming to outdo myself and show off my skills in a real-world scenario. I'll be putting in the hard work, staying focused, and strategizing with my teammates to make it to the top. Wish me luck! Hey, I'm Ariel Santana! I'm a 20-year-old university student with a passion for pushing limits and creating positive change. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new tech and developing innovative solutions to real-world problems. This datathon is all about challenging myself to be the best and coming out on top. I've participated in hackathons before, but I've yet to win the top prize. This time, I'm determined to do just that. With my drive and team spirit, I'm confident I can make a big impact and take home the top prize.
