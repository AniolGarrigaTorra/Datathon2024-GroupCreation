Hey there! I'm Alessia, and my objective for this datathon is all about soaking up the experience and making unforgettable memories. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, trying out innovative projects, and participating in as many events as I can. I'm all about having fun and learning new things, but my top priority is building those meaningful connections with fellow datathon enthusiasts. Whether it's over a late-night coffee break or during an impromptu game of Mario Kart, I want to leave this event with a handful of new buddies who share my passion for tech and creativity. Wish me luck! Hi everyone! I'm Alessia, and I'm super excited to be here for this datathon adventure! As a 21-year-old student, I'm a third-year veteran of code-bashing and data-massaging. When I'm not drowning in assignments or playing with gadgets, I'm a self-proclaimed geek for AI, IoT, and AR/VR. I thrive on learning new languages and whipping them into shape for innovative projects. Above all, I'm all about community, connection, and making memories. Can't wait to meet fellow tech enthusiasts and make this datathon one to remember!
