Hey! As a beginner coder, I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon. My objective is to soak up as much knowledge as I can and push my programming skills to the next level. I'm hoping to get exposed to new technologies, techniques, and ideas that will help me become a better programmer. I'm not too concerned about winning (although it's nice too); what matters most to me is having the opportunity to learn and grow with the support of the community and my fellow participants. I'm ready to get coding and take in as much as I can! Hey there! I'm Ava Flynn, a first-year student with a passion for problem-solving and a thirst for knowledge. I've been fascinated by how technology can revolutionize the way we live and work, and I'm excited to be a part of this datathon. As a beginner programmer, I'm looking forward to stretching my coding muscles and gaining valuable experience. Outside of coding, I'm always on the lookout for lifehacks and new ideas that can make my life easier. Can't wait to meet you all and start building together!
