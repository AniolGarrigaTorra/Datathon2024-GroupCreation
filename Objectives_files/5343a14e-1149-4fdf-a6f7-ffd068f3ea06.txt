My objective for this datathon is to immerse myself in a challenging and dynamic environment that will help me improve my coding skills and broaden my technical knowledge. I want to learn as much as I can from my fellow participants, mentors, and workshop sessions. I'm excited to dive into new technologies, tackle real-world problems, and develop my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I'm looking forward to stepping out of my comfort zone and emerging as a more competent programmer by the end of the event. Hey! I'm Aurora, an 18-year-old student excited to be part of this datathon. As a coding enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. With a background in programming and a love for solving real-world problems, I'm looking to learn and grow with fellow participants and mentors. My ideal environment is a dynamic space where I can immerse myself in coding, explore new technologies, and develop my critical thinking skills. Can't wait to get started and see what the next 24 hours bring!
