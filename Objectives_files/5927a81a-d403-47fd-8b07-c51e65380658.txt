As a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning, my objective for this datathon is to improve my programming skills and learn new things. I'm excited to dive into new datasets, experiment with different tools and techniques, and push my coding abilities to the next level. I'm hoping to learn from fellow participants, mentors, and online resources to boost my knowledge in machine learning and data analysis. My goal is to gain practical experience and confidence in my skills, making me a more well-rounded and competent developer by the end of this datathon. Hi!
