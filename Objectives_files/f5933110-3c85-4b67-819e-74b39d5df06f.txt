My objective for this datathon is to take it as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills! I'm excited to dive into new technologies, challenge myself with unique datasets, and level up my programming abilities. I'm not looking to compete or focus solely on winning; my goal is to come away from this event with a newfound skill or technique that I can apply to my studies and future projects. I'm all about personal growth and development, and this datathon is the perfect place to achieve that! Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 2nd-year student with a passion for tech and learning. I've been experimenting with coding since I was a teenager, and now I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. I'm all about exploring new frontiers and mastering emerging technologies. I'm curious, a bit quirky, and always up for a challenge. My aim is to level up my programming abilities and maybe even stumble upon a new niche that sparks my creativity. Can't wait to connect with fellow participants and learn from each other's unique perspectives!
