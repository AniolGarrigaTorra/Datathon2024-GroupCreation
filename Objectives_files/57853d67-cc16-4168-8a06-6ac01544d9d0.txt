Hey! So, I'm really excited to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to use this event as an opportunity to meet new people and make friends. I've learned so much from hackathons and bootcamps before, and I'm super enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and learning from others. For me, it's all about creating an unforgettable experience - one that I'll remember for years to come. You'll usually find me participating in workshops, networking with fellow participants, and having a blast at the after-parties. Let's get this party started! Hey everyone! I'm Lena Braunstein Mart√≠n, a 20-year-old undergraduate student with a passion for tech and lifehacks. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me digging into new programming skills or exploring the world of cybersecurity. I've had an absolute blast at previous hackathons and bootcamps, and I'm super stoked to be here today! I'm all about creating unforgettable experiences and connecting with like-minded folks. Expect me to be bouncing around, soaking up knowledge, and living life to the fullest!
