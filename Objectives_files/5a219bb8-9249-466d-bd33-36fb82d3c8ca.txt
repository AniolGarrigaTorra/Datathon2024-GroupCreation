Hey! My objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into new challenges and learn as much as I can. As a student, I'm eager to expand my skills and knowledge in programming, and I'm excited to see what opportunities this event brings. I'm hoping to pick up new techniques, tools, and strategies from others, and to apply them to real-world problems. I'm not too fussed about winning or being top of the leaderboard - my priority is to learn, grow, and come away with a newfound sense of confidence and ability. Hey there! I'm Vittoria, a third-year student who's passionate about technology and problem-solving. When I'm not hitting the books, I love digging into new coding projects and exploring innovative solutions. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to challenge myself, learn from others, and apply my skills to real-world challenges. I'm not just here to win - I'm eager to grow, take risks, and gain confidence in my abilities. I'm a curious and creative problem-solver, and I'm excited to see what the datathon has in store!
