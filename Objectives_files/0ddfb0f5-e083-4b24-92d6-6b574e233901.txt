Hey! I'm Sofia, and I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My main goal is to learn as much as I can and take my skills to the next level. I've had some experience with programming, but I'm eager to challenge myself with new tech and techniques. I'm looking to soak up as much knowledge as possible, experiment with different approaches, and refine my problem-solving skills. I want to walk away from this event feeling like I've grown as a developer and have a bunch of awesome new ideas to tackle in the future. Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 21-year-old student excited to be here at the datathon. I've been dipping my toes into the world of programming for a bit, but I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I'm passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact, and I'm intrigued by the intersection of tech and social good. I'm a total newbie when it comes to [insert current favorite topic], but I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with others. I'm looking forward to seeing what this datathon has in store!
