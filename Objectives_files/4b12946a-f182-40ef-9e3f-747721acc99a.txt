Hey! My objective for this datathon is to have a blast, chill with fellow participants, and get my game on! I'm super stoked to be part of this community, and I'm looking forward to meeting new folks, attending as many events as I can, and just having an amazing time! I'm down for a good time, and I'm hoping to make some unforgettable memories with my new friends! Hey there! I'm Ã€ngels, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon community! As a 20-year-old student, I'm always looking for opportunities to geek out with fellow tech enthusiasts. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or tinkering with my latest robotic projects. My friends would describe me as chill and creative, always up for a good time and eager to learn from others. I'm looking forward to this crazy fun experience, making new friends, and soaking up as much knowledge as possible. See you around!
