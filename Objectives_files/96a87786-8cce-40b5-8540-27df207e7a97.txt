Hi! As I prepare for this datathon, my main objective is to learn as much as I can and take my skills to the next level. I'm excited to tackle new challenges and improve my programming abilities, and I hope to do so by collaborating with others and learning from their experiences. I'm open to feedback and willing to take risks to try out new techniques and approaches. I'm looking forward to absorbing as much knowledge as possible and coming out of this datathon feeling more confident and prepared to take on bigger projects. Hi there! I'm Alejandra Rose Ventura, an 18-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I'm in my second year of studying programming and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. I've always been fascinated by how technology can transform industries and people's lives. Outside of coding, I'm a creative soul who loves music and art. I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals, learning from their experiences, and stepping out of my comfort zone to tackle new challenges. Bring on the creative problem-solving and innovative ideas!
