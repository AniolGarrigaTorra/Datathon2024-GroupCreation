My objective? I'm all about winning here. I've participated in five hackathons, and I've learned that when you set your sights on the top spot, you'll do whatever it takes to get there. I'm coming in focused, my coding skills are sharp, and I'm ready to crush it. My goal is to take home that top prize and prove to myself that all the late nights, early mornings, and caffeine-filled study sessions were worth it. Bring on the challenges - I'm ready to rise to the top and show everyone what I'm capable of. Game on! Hey, I'm Liam Ryder. I'm a third-year student with a passion for building and creating. Throughout my college journey, I've developed a strong foundation in programming, which has fueled my competitive streak. I've taken part in five hackathons, and I'm always eager to learn from my experiences. My goal is to rise to the top of this datathon and prove to myself that all my hard work has paid off. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech and creative pursuits. Let's see what the datathon has in store - I'm ready to bring my A-game!
