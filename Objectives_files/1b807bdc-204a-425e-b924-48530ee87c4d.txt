As a 2nd-year student with limited experience in programming, my goal for this datathon is to focus on having a great time! I'm excited to meet new people, learn from their experiences, and collaborate on projects that interest me. I'm looking forward to attending workshops, talks, and social events, and maybe even try out some new programming skills. At the end of the day, my objective is to make genuine connections and take home some awesome memories - I'm ready to geek out and have fun! Hey, I'm Emilie! I'm a 2nd-year student, still learning the ropes of programming, but excited to dive deeper at this datathon. I've got a fascination with bringing creative ideas to life, and I love exploring how tech can make a difference. You'll find me buzzing around workshops and talks, soaking up new skills and expertise, and maybe even attempting some new code challenges (wish me luck!). I'm all about connection and having a blast with like-minded folks - can't wait to share laughs and create unforgettable memories!
