Hey! I'm Emilia Windsor, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is all about having a blast with fellow coders while taking away some sweet skills. I'm looking to make new friends, have an amazing time, and participate in as many events as possible. I want to chill with like-minded people, learn some cool things, and share some laughs. I'm not too fussed about the competitive aspect, I just want to soak up the atmosphere, try out new tools, and make some unforgettable memories. Hey there! I'm Emilia Windsor, a 22-year-old student with a passion for coding and making a positive impact. I'm thrilled to be here at the datathon, where I'm all about having a blast with fellow tech enthusiasts and taking away some valuable skills. As a budding developer, I love dabbling in different tools and tech to solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with art, music, or volunteering for social causes. I'm stoked to share my experiences and learn from you all!
