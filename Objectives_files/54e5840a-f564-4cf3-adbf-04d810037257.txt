As a aspiring developer, I'm all about setting high goals for myself and achieving them! For this datathon, my objective is to put my skills to the test and bring home the win. I'll pour my heart and soul into solving the challenge and perfecting my code. I'm determined to be the one with the best solution, and I won't let anything get in the way of that. I'm ready to give it my all, work tirelessly, and push myself to the limit to claim the top spot! Hey there! I'm Luna, a 19-year-old student with a passion for coding and making a name for myself in the developer world. I'm in my first year and already hooked on Rust and Java. I love pushing boundaries and setting ambitious goals for myself. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to music or lost in art galleries. This datathon is my chance to put my skills to the test, showcase my talent, and make my mark. I'm all about hard work, dedication, and that winning feeling - let's make this happen!
