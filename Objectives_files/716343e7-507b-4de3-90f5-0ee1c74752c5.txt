Hey! So, I'm pretty stoked to be at this datathon and I'm all about making the most of it. My main goal is to have an amazing time, hang out with other participants, and learn about new tech stuff in a casual vibe. I want to jump into as many events and activities as I can, even if I'm not entirely sure what they're about. I'm really looking forward to sharing laughs and memories with my fellow datathon-goers, and making some awesome new friends along the way! Hey there! I'm Helena, and I'm thrilled to be here at the datathon. I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and exploring new tech concepts. I've always been fascinated by the impact technology can have on people's lives, whether it's through health innovations, sustainable energy, or accessibility solutions. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me trying out new programming languages or experimenting with the latest IoT projects. I'm all about creating something meaningful and having a blast while doing it. Let's make some unforgettable memories, fellow datathon-goers!
