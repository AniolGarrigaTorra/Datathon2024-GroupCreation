I'm looking forward to this datathon as an opportunity to relax and have a blast with fellow data enthusiasts. My objective is to make new friends, attend as many workshops and events as possible, and soak up the vibe. I'd love to learn new skills and pick up some fresh ideas, but my main goal is to make this a memorable and enjoyable experience. I'm hoping to bond with like-minded people over shared passions, share laughter and stories, and create some awesome memories - with maybe a hint of productivity sprinkled in! Hey there! I'm Evelyn Wynter, a second-year student with a passion for tech and creative pursuits. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, looking forward to meeting fellow data enthusiasts and making new friends. I'm all about soaking up new experiences, learning new skills, and sharing laughter with like-minded individuals. When I'm not hacking away at code, you can find me experimenting with design or tinkering with IoT projects. I'm a firm believer that life is what you make it, and I'm here to make the most of this incredible opportunity!
