My objective for this datathon is crystal clear - I'm here to win! With one hackathon under my belt and a solid grasp on programming basics, I'm eager to test my skills and outdo my fellow competitors. I've been studying for weeks, honing my coding chops and brushing up on data analysis techniques. I'm ready to bring my A-game and come out on top. I'm looking forward to a 36-hour sprint of intense coding, problem-solving, and brain-storming with fellow coding warriors. Bring it on, I'm ready to take the crown! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a third-year student on a mission to take the datathon by storm. With a solid foundation in programming and a passion for problem-solving, I'm eager to put my skills to the test. I've been preparing for weeks, and I'm excited to dive into the world of data analytics. Gaming and e-commerce are my guilty pleasures, and I believe that the thrill of competition is what drives me to improve. When I'm not coding, you can find me discovering lifehacks or exploring new places. I'm ready to put my skills to the test and make my mark in this datathon!
