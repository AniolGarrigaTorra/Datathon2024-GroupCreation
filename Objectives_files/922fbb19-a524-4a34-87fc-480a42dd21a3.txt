Hey! As a participant, my goal for this datathon is to dive headfirst into learning and improving my skills. I've had some experience in programming, but I know there's always room for growth. I'm excited to explore new technologies and tackle challenges that will help me level up. My objective is to learn as much as possible, whether it's through hands-on coding, attending workshops, or networking with other participants. I'm looking forward to a productive and immersive experience that will help me become a better developer and gain valuable insights from the community! Hey there! I'm Luna, a 19-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving and creative expression. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming out to music, whipping up some art, or digging into the latest gaming releases. I'm a curious individual with a knack for finding new tech challenges to tackle. For this datathon, I'm all about leveling up my programming skills and expanding my horizons. I'm looking forward to immersing myself in a world of innovation and collaboration - can't wait to see what awesomeness we can create together!
