My objective for this datathon is to level up my skills and make the most of this learning opportunity. I'm aiming to dive deep into the latest trends and technologies, and use this challenge to identify areas where I can improve my coding skills. I'm excited to take on new challenges, ask questions, and learn from others. I'm hoping to come out of this event with a new project under my belt and a sense of accomplishment, knowing that I've grown as a developer. Hey! I'm Avery, a fourth-year student looking to level up my coding skills at this datathon. I've been fiddling with programming for a few years now, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the latest trends and technologies. I'm a self-proclaimed problem-solver and love the feeling of overcoming hurdles. My aim is to identify areas where I can improve and take on new challenges. I'm all about continuous learning and growth, and I'm looking forward to this event to learn from others, ask questions, and take my coding skills to the next level!
