I'm super excited to take part in this datathon! My main goal is to make the most of this amazing opportunity to meet like-minded folks and have an absolute blast while doing it. I'm all about enjoying the experience, learning some new things, and soaking up the creative energy around me. I'm not too bothered about winning, I'd rather participate in as many events as possible, attend all the cool workshops, and connect with new people. Can't wait to see what this datathon brings! Hey there! I'm Sacha, a 21-year-old third-year student with a passion for making a positive impact. I'm all about learning and adapting, always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay ahead of the curve. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me dabbling in mobile app development or playing the latest games with friends. I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon, where I can network with like-minded folks, indulge in new tech and ideas, and maybe even stumble upon my next big project!
