As a participant, I'm really looking forward to making new connections and having an amazing time with fellow data enthusiasts! My objective is to soak up as much fun as possible while collaborating with others and learning new skills along the way. I'm excited to participate in as many events, workshops, and challenges as I can, and maybe even stumble upon some new inspiration or insights. Above all, I want to leave the datathon feeling energized, friendships enriched, and a sense of belonging in this vibrant community! Hey there! I'm Evangelina, a 20-year-old student diving into the world of data. I'm excited to be here and meet fellow enthusiasts. When I'm not studying, you can find me exploring the realm of enterprise software and the potential of blockchain technology. I'm all about innovation and collaboration, which is why I'm stoked to be part of this datathon. I'm looking forward to soaking up knowledge, making new friends, and having a blast while doing it. Let's make some unforgettable memories and push the boundaries of what's possible with data!
