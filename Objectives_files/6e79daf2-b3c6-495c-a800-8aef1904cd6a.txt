My objective for this datathon is straightforward - I'm here to win. With my experience in programming and nine hackathons under my belt, I'm eager to put my skills to the test and push myself to the limit. I'm not looking to make friends (though that's a nice bonus) and I'm not interested in just having fun (as much as that sounds appealing, I'm all about the competitive edge). I want to learn from others, gather insights from the mentors, and ultimately take home that top prize. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Lucy, a 22-year-old student with a passion for innovation and a drive to succeed. I've spent years honing my programming skills, from computer vision to data analysis, and I'm always looking for new challenges. I've got a solid foundation in software development and I'm not afraid to take risks. I've competed in nine hackathons and I'm itching to push myself to the limit. My goal is to win, plain and simple. But don't get me wrong, I'm happy to collaborate and learn from others along the way. Let's crush this datathon!
