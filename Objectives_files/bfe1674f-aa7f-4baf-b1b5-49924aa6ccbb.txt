My objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into the world of data analysis and programming. I've never participated in a hackathon before, and I'm excited to learn new skills and improve my knowledge. I'm looking to absorb as much as I can from the workshops, lectures, and peer discussions. I'm hoping to take away practical insights and techniques that I can apply to my studies and future projects. By focusing on learning and improvement, I'm open to taking risks and trying new approaches - it's going to be an amazing experience! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a curious and adventurous first-year student eager to dive into the world of data analysis. With a passion for creative problem-solving and tech, I'm excited to trade my textbooks for a coding keyboard. I'm looking forward to immersing myself in this datathon experience, where I'll take calculated risks, learn from fellow participants, and absorb as much as I can. My ultimate goal is to develop practical skills and insights that'll enhance my studies and future projects. Let's see what adventures await!
