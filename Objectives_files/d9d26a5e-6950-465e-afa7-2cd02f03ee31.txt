I'm all about having an awesome time and making lasting connections at this datathon! As a long-time hackathon enthusiast, I've come to realize that the journey itself is what makes it so worth it. I'm not super competitive and would rather take my time to soak up the vibes, learn some new skills along the way, and participate in as many events and activities as possible. I'm stoked to meet fellow participants who share my vibe and make some unforgettable memories together! Hey there! I'm Ava, a 21-year-old student who's stoked to be here at the datathon! I've always been passionate about using tech to make a positive impact, and I love diving into new projects and challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with augmented reality or indulging in a good sci-fi novel. I'm all about soaking up the datathon vibes and making new connections. No drama, no stress - just an awesome time with awesome people. Can't wait to see what kind of wild adventures await!
