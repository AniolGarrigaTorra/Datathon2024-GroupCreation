My objective for this datathon is to have an absolute blast! I'm not about being a competitive powerhouse, but more about soaking up the atmosphere, meeting fellow datathon enthusiasts, and learning together. I'm excited to participate in as many events and challenges as I can, and I'm all about having fun with the team I'm working with. If we happen to whip up a mind-blowing solution along the way, that's just the cherry on top! My goal is to create unforgettable memories and take home a datathon spirit that's more precious than any prize. Hey there! I'm Evelyn, a 22-year-old student living life to the fullest. When I'm not glued to my books, you can find me jamming out to my favorite tunes or getting creative with some art. I'm all about being productive and getting things done, whether that's coding a new project or planning the next adventure. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, ready to take on new challenges and soak up the energy with fellow datathon enthusiasts. I'm all about having fun and making unforgettable memories - let's do this!
