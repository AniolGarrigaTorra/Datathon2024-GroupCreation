Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to make it an unforgettable experience, not just for the prizes, but for the connections I make and the fun I have. I'm looking forward to meeting like-minded people, learning from them, and sharing my own experiences. I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, try out new technologies, and take part in workshops and training sessions. I'm all about creating a supportive community, and I hope to walk away from this datathon with some awesome new friends and unforgettable memories! Hey everyone, I'm Sofia! I'm a 18-year-old student with a passion for using technology to drive positive change. I'm currently in my second year of university, and my experience with programming so far has been all about learning and experimenting. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon, not just for the awesome prizes, but for the chance to meet like-minded people and learn from them. I'm all about fostering a supportive community, and I'm looking forward to making unforgettable memories with all of you!
