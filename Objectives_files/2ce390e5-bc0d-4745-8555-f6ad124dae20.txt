As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to participate in this datathon! My primary objective is to expand my skills and knowledge in programming and data analysis. I've had a solid foundation in programming, but I'm eager to dive deeper and get hands-on experience with new tools and techniques. During this datathon, I want to absorb as much as I can, experiment with different approaches, and learn from others. I'm hoping to come out with new insights, improved coding skills, and a broader perspective on data analysis. Let the learning begin! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a third-year student with a passion for making a positive impact through data. I've always been intrigued by the power of data analysis in solving real-world problems, and I'm excited to bring my intermediate programming skills to this datathon. With a solid foundation in programming, I'm now looking to broaden my horizons and explore new tools and techniques. I'm a curious and adventurous learner, always eager to dive into new challenges and absorb knowledge like a sponge. I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences and learning from others!
