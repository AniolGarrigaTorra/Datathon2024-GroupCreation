Here's my objective:

As a participant, I'm all about having a blast and making new friends. I'm super stoked to be a part of this datathon and I'm looking forward to immersing myself in the vibrant atmosphere. My goal is to soak up as much fun as possible, participate in as many events as I can, and meet awesome people who share my passion for tech. I'm not too worried about winning or placing high; for me, it's all about creating unforgettable memories and having a fantastic time with fellow tech enthusiasts. See you there! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a 22-year-old student with a passion for creating impact through tech. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me playing around with coding or attending design workshops. I'm all about finding innovative solutions to everyday problems and loving how it brings people together. For this datathon, I'm looking forward to a thrilling experience, making new friends, and having a blast! Let's have some amazing times and create unforgettable memories - can't wait to meet you all!
