Hey! I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere and making the most of this datathon experience. My goal is to have a blast, meet new people, and participate in as many events as I can. I want to learn a bit, but for me, it's all about having fun and making new friends. I'm excited to see what the organizers have planned and to be a part of it all. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Llu√Øsa, a 20-year-old student with a passion for using tech for good. I'm all about trying new things and meeting fellow enthusiasts who share my zeal. This datathon is the perfect spot for me to network, learn from the best, and contribute to exciting projects. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me brainstorming innovative ideas or jamming to some tunes. For me, this event is all about soaking up the energy, having a blast, and making meaningful connections. Ready to kick off this exciting journey?
