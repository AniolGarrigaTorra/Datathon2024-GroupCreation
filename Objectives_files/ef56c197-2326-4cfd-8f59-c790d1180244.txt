My goal for this datathon is to dive head-first into the world of data and learning. I'm excited to tackle new challenges, and see how far I can push my skills in programming and data analysis. I'm not particularly focused on winning, but more about learning from others, experimenting with different approaches, and taking home valuable skills to improve my portfolio. I'd love to explore new technologies and domains, and who knows, maybe discover a new passion or direction. It's all about growth and self-improvement for me, and I'm stoked to be here! Hey there!
