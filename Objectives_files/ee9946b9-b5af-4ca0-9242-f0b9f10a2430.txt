Hey! As a participant in this datathon, my main objective is to challenge myself and improve my skills in programming and data analysis. I've been learning Python for a few years now, but I'm eager to dive deeper into areas like machine learning and data visualization. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone and take on projects that will help me grow professionally. I'm excited to learn from others, get feedback, and develop new tools to add to my toolkit. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Lupita Gonz√°lez! I'm a third-year student with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. I've been dabbling in programming for a few years now, and I'm excited to challenge myself at this datathon. I've always been fascinated by how data can be used to make a real impact, and I'm looking forward to diving deeper into areas like machine learning and data visualization. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new recipes or trying to come up with creative solutions to everyday challenges.
