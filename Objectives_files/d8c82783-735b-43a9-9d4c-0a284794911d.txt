Hey! My objective for this datathon is pretty simple - I want to make the most of this event and have an awesome time! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, learning from them, and making some great friends. I'll be participating in as many events and activities as I can, trying new things, and maybe even taking on a side project or two. I want to go home from this datathon feeling inspired, motivated, and with a big ol' smile on my face. No stress, no rush, just fun and excitement! Hi everyone! I'm Aurora, a 21-year-old fourth-year student with a passion for creating impact through technology. I've got a solid foundation in programming and love exploring the endless possibilities in the world of software development. When I'm not diving into code, you can find me geeking out over blockchain, productivity tools, or innovative design. I'm all about making the most of this datathon, learning from others, and having an amazing time! I'm looking forward to meeting you all and potentially working together on some exciting projects. Let's make some unforgettable memories!
