Hey! As for me, my objective for this datathon is to have an amazing time and make new friends along the way! I've always loved collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts, and I'm stoked to meet others who share my passion for data. I'm not super competitive, so my goal isn't to be the first to submit a solution. I just want to enjoy the atmosphere, participate in cool events, and pick up some new skills along the way. I'm looking forward to networking, trying out new projects, and making memories with fellow participants! Hey there! I'm Aurora, an 18-year-old student bursting with enthusiasm for all things tech. I'm in my second year of university, where I've developed a passion for bringing innovative ideas to life. I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon and can't wait to dive into the world of data. As a creative problem-solver, I love experimenting with new skills and collaborating with like-minded individuals. This datathon is a chance for me to expand my skills, make new friends, and contribute to exciting projects that can make a positive impact. See you around!
