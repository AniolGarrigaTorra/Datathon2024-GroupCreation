Hey! My objective for this datathon is to make new friends, have an awesome time, and participate in as many cool events as possible. I'm not really into the whole competitive vibe, and I'd rather focus on meeting fellow datathon enthusiasts, learning from each other, and having a blast together. I'm stoked to hang out with the other participants, attend sessions, and even try out new programming languages or tools that catch my eye. Ultimately, I just want to soak up all the excitement and energy and create unforgettable memories with an amazing community! Hi everyone! I'm Aur√©lien, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon. As a 4th-year student, I'm really passionate about using code to create meaningful connections between people and technology. When I'm not in class, you can find me tinkering with new languages, tools, and techniques to see what I can come up with. I'm all about collaboration, creativity, and having a blast with like-minded individuals. I'm here to learn, make new friends, and soak up all the excitement. Let's do this, and have some awesome fun together!
