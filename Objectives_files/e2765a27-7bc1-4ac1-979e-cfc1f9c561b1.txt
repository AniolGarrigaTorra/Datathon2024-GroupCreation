Hey! As a second-year student and aspiring data wizard, I'm heading into this datathon with a clear objective: to dive head-first into the world of data and learn as much as possible. I'm excited to challenge myself, try new tools and techniques, and improve my coding skills. Whether it's picking up new libraries, understanding complex algorithms, or just getting more comfortable working with data, my ultimate goal is to leave this datathon a better programmer than when I arrived. Can't wait to get started and soak up all the knowledge I can! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 19-year-old student excited to dive into the world of data at this datathon. I've got a passion for pushing boundaries and learning new tricks, which is why I'm here - to level up my skills, challenge myself, and maybe even stumble upon some cool new tech. In my free time, I love experimenting with code, jamming out to games, and staying up-to-date on the latest innovation trends. Can't wait to meet fellow datathoners and get our data geek on!
