My goal for this datathon is to have an amazing time and make some new buddies! I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere, trying new things, and getting involved in every cool activity I can find. Whether it's a hackathon workshop, a team-building game, or just a casual chat with fellow participants, I'm all about vibing and making memories with like-minded folks. Bring on the data, bring on the pizza, and let's have a blast! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lie, a 21-year-old third-year student trying to make the most out of this datathon experience! When I'm not studying or programming, you can find me vibing to some sick tunes or getting creative with art. As an aspiring DevOps enthusiast, I'm all about efficiency and making things work seamlessly. My goal for this event is to make friends, learn new things, and have a blast! I'm stoked to meet fellow participants, share some laughter, and create unforgettable memories. Bring on the adventure, and let's make some magic happen!
