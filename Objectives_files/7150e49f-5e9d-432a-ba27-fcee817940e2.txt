My objective for this datathon is to make the most out of it from a learning perspective. I'm looking forward to digging deeper into machine learning and data visualization, and experimenting with new tools and techniques. I hope to walk away with a solid understanding of how to apply these concepts to real-world problems. My goal is to improve my skills and knowledge in areas where I feel I need the most growth, and to use this experience to push my personal project goals forward. I'm excited to collaborate with others and learn from their strengths as well. Hey there! I'm Samantha, an 18-year-old undergrad student diving into the world of data and tech. With a passion for using technology to make a difference, I'm excited to be here at the datathon. In my free time, I tinker with IoT projects and experiment with machine learning algorithms to see what kind of cool things I can create. This datathon is all about growth for me - I'm looking forward to pushing my boundaries, learning from others, and taking my skills to the next level. Ready to dive in and make some progress!
