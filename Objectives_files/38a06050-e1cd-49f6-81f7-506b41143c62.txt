I'm coming to this datathon to crush it. I'm a fierce competitor and I'm driven to win. I want to show off my coding skills and be the first one to slap my hands down on the keyboard to submit the correct answer. I've got my game face on, and I'm prepared to put in the late nights and hours of practice to get to the top of the leaderboard. It's not about having fun (although, don't get me wrong, I'll have a blast too), it's about taking home that sweet, sweet victory and bragging rights for another hackathon under my belt. Hey, I'm Evelyn Reed! I'm a 20-year-old third-year student and I'm all about competition and winning. When I'm not in class, you can find me coding away on my latest project or perfecting my gaming skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments and I'm not afraid to put in the long hours to get things done. I'm all about efficiency, whether it's optimizing my workflow or crushing a game. I'm excited to be here at the datathon and prove to myself that I'm capable of overcoming any challenge. Bring it on!
