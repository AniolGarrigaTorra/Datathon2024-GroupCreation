Hey, I'm Alba Estela Thompson, a 23-year-old master's student with a passion for problem-solving and a drive to succeed. When I'm not devouring books on the latest tech trends or coding up a storm, you can find me gaming or experimenting with lifehacks to boost productivity. My sights are set on the top prize at this datathon, and I'm confident that my skills in blockchain, machine learning, and software development will help me get there. I'm all about staying ahead of the curve and always pushing myself to be the best.
