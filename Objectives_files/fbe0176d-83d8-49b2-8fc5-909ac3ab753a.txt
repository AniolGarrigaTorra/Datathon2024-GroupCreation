My goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and dive into new topics. As a junior programmer, I've had a solid foundation, but I want to stretch my wings and learn more advanced techniques. I'm excited to work with others who share similar interests and expertise, and learn from their experiences. I'm looking forward to tackling real-world problems and being challenged to think outside the box. My goal is to improve my data analysis and visualization skills, and come away from this event feeling confident in my abilities and equipped with practical knowledge I can apply in my future projects. Hey there! I'm VÃ­ctora, a third-year student with a passion for programming and problem-solving. I've been dabbling in coding for a bit now, and I'm excited to level up my skills at this datathon. I'm particularly intrigued by databases and robotic process automation - there's something about harnessing data to drive insights that gets me hyped! Outside of coding, you can find me geeking out over the latest gaming releases or exploring design software like Figma. I'm all about learning from others and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. Let's crush this datathon!
