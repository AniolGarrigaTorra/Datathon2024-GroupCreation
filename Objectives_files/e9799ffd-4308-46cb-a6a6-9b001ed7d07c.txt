Hey, my objective for this datathon is to level up my programming skills and learn as much as I can from the challenges and workshops. I'm not super competitive, so I'm not worried about winning first place, but I do want to challenge myself and take my skills to the next level. I'm really interested in exploring new technologies and languages, and I'm hoping to pick up some new tricks and ideas from the experts here. Most importantly, I just want to take away a sense of accomplishment and pride in knowing I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone! Hey, I'm Alejandro! I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and innovation. I'm all about taking on new challenges and pushing myself to grow. For this datathon, I'm eager to level up my programming skills and dive into the world of data science. I'm particularly excited to explore the intersection of tech and music, and to discover fresh perspectives from the expert participants and speakers. Outside of tech, I'm a music enthusiast and art lover. I'm looking forward to an unforgettable experience and new friendships!
