As a competitive and driven individual, my objective for this datathon is to bring home the trophy! I want to focus all my energy on designing and building a game-changing project that sets me apart from the rest. I've got experience under my belt from participating in four hackathons, and I'm excited to test my skills against the best of the best. I'm all about being ruthless when it comes to innovation, efficiency, and quality, so get ready for some fierce competition! I'm willing to put in the hard work and push myself to deliver an outstanding project that makes a lasting impression. Hey there! I'm Luz Ashley Rodriguez, a 22-year-old driven student with a passion for innovation and a hunger to push boundaries. I've always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and create positive change. With experience in hackathons and a knack for staying ahead of the curve, I'm confident in my ability to think outside the box and deliver high-quality solutions. Expect a competitive and motivated participant who is willing to put in the extra effort to stand out from the crowd. I'm stoked to be here and ready to crush this datathon!
