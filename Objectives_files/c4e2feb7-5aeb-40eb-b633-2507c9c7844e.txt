I'm Mercè, and I'm all about leveling up my skills. I've participated in a few hackathons before, and I've loved the rush of building something new from scratch. This datathon, I want to focus on pushing myself to learn more about data analysis and visualisation. I'd love to dive deeper into tools like Tableau or Power BI, and explore how I can apply them to real-world problems. My goal is to walk away with a solid understanding of a new skill and a project that showcases my improvement. I'm excited to learn alongside other like-minded individuals! Hey! I'm Mercè, a 21-year-old student with a passion for turning ideas into reality. I've had my share of hackathons, but this datathon is different - I'm aiming to level up my data analysis skills. I want to dive into visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI and apply them to real-world problems. I'm excited to push myself and learn alongside fellow innovators. My goal is to create a project that showcases my new skills and walks away feeling proud of my progress. Looking forward to meeting fellow participants and making new connections!
