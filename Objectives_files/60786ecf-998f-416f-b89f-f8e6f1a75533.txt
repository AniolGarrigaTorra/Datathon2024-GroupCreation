Hey there! As Ashley, my objective for this datathon is to let loose, have a blast, and meet some awesome people along the way. I'm not super competitive, so I won't be worried about winning. Instead, I'm looking forward to diving into new tech and trying out different tools and projects. But most importantly, I want to make some genuine connections with fellow participants and create lifelong friendships. I'm excited to soak up the datathon energy, participate in workshops and events, and maybe even stumble upon a new passion project! See you there! Hey! I'm Ashley, a 20-year-old student, excited to be part of this datathon adventure! I'm passionate about blending tech with social good, and I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to make a positive impact. I'm a big fan of trying new things and learning from my mistakes. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring design or tinkering with robotics. I'm looking forward to meeting awesome people like you, exchanging ideas, and maybe even stumbling upon a new passion project. See you around!
