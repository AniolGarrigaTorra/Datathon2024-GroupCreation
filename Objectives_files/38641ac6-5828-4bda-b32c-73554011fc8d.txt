My objective for this datathon is to soak up the atmosphere and make the most of this incredible experience! I'm not too concerned about winning or being the best, I just want to meet new people, make friends, and have a blast. I'm excited to participate in as many events as I can, whether it's a hackathon challenge, a workshop, or even just a casual game night. My goal is to leave with a bunch of new friends and memories that'll last a lifetime. I'm all about embracing the vibes and making the most of this datathon adventure! Hey there! I'm Rebecca, a 19-year-old student with a passion for technology and making a positive impact. I'm thrilled to be participating in this datathon, looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts, learning new skills, and having an amazing time. When I'm not coding, you can find me creating music, drawing, or exploring new productivity hacks. I'm all about community, creativity, and growth, and I'm excited to soak up the atmosphere and make the most of this incredible experience. Let's do this!
