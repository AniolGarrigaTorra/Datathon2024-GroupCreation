Hey! As Aurora, I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! My goal is to just have an amazing time, meet new people, and enjoy all the events. I want to attend workshops, participate in hackathons, and maybe even try some art and music activities. As a student, I'm learning so much in class, but I also value the importance of social connections. I'm looking forward to laughing, sharing stories, and making unforgettable memories with fellow participants. Bring on the excitement and let's have the best datathon ever! Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 19-year-old student with a passion for making connections and learning new things. I'm currently exploring the world of coding, with a special interest in how technology can shape the future of e-commerce and cybersecurity. When I'm not in class, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. For this datathon, I'm excited to meet new people, attend fun workshops, and soak up all the amazing energy the event has to offer. Let's make some unforgettable memories together!
