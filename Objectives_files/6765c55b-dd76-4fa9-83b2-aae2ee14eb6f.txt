My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this opportunity to learn new skills and broaden my understanding of data science. As a student with a moderate level of programming experience, I'm eager to dive deeper into specific technologies and techniques that will give me an edge in the industry. I want to focus on understanding data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools, so I can develop a solid foundation to apply in my future projects. I'm excited to challenge myself and push my limits to become a more skilled data analyst and problem solver. Hi! I'm Sandra, a fourth-year student excited to be part of this datathon. I've been playing around with code since I was a teenager, and my passion lies in using it to make a positive impact. I've had a taste of programming languages like Java and Rust, and I've fallen in love with the problem-solving aspect. I'm looking to further develop my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. My goal for this datathon is to take on new challenges and become a more confident and skilled data analyst. Can't wait to collaborate and learn with you all!
