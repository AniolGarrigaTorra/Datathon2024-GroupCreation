As someone who's just dipped their toes into the world of coding, I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon! My objective is clear: I want to learn new things and improve my skills. I'm hoping to pick up some new techniques, brush up on my existing knowledge, and walk away with some fresh perspectives. I'm not too fussed about competing or winning (although a prize would be nice!). I just want to make the most of this experience and come out with a newfound confidence in my abilities. Bring on the challenges! Hey there! I'm Lena Wellesley, a 19-year-old student eager to take on the datathon challenge. I've been tinkering with code for a bit, and I'm excited to stretch my skills further. I'm all about using tech to make a positive impact, and this datathon offers the perfect opportunity to learn from others and grow. I'm looking forward to exploring new techniques, refining my craft, and picking up some fresh insights. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring health and communication-related projects. Can't wait to get started!
