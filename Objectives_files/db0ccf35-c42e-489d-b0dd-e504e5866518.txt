Hey, I'm Sofía! My goal for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge as possible and challenge myself to grow my skills. I'm really eager to learn new techniques, tackle complex problems, and get hands-on experience with real-world datasets. I'm looking forward to networking with fellow participants and mentors, and getting feedback on my work. I'm hoping to walk away from this event with a fresh perspective, some new tricks up my sleeve, and a stronger foundation in data analysis. Bring on the learning adventure! Hey!
