Hey! I'm Emily, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to have a blast while making new friends and being part of the awesome community here. I'm all about trying out new tools and tech, but I'm not too worried about winning - for me, it's all about the vibes, networking, and getting pumped up alongside everyone else! I'm down to grab lunch, attend some awesome workshops, and join forces with fellow datathoners to create something incredible. Who knows, maybe we'll crack open some crazy creative ideas and have an epic time doing it! Hey! I'm Emily, a second-year student with a passion for trying new things. I love tinkering with tech, designing solutions, and finding creative ways to make a difference. When I'm not hit the books, you can find me jamming to tunes or sketching in my notebook. I'm all about that community vibe, and this datathon is the perfect place to do so. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts, learning from each other, and maybe, just maybe, crafting something life-changing together! Let's have some fun and get creative!
