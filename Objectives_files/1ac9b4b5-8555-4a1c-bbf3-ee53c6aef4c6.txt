Hey there! I'm Alex, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon! My main goal for this weekend is to have an absolute blast! I want to make new friends and connections within the datathon community. I'm all about having fun and being social, so you can bet I'll be attending every single event I can - from workshops to hackathons to game nights. Let's crush this datathon together, learn some new skills along the way, and make some unforgettable memories! Hey everyone! I'm Alex, a 22-year-old student thrilled to be here at the datathon! When I'm not hitting the books, I love exploring innovative technologies and making new connections. I'm all about having a good time, being social, and learning new tricks along the way. My passion lies in solving real-world problems, and I believe this weekend is the perfect opportunity to make that happen. I'm looking forward to meeting new faces, exchanging ideas, and having an absolute blast!
