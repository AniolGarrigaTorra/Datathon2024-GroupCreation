Hey there! As a participant in this datathon, my goal is simple: I want to have a blast, learn a thing or two, and make new friends along the way! I'm all about the experience, not just about winning. I'm hoping to soak up as much as I can from the workshop sessions, mingle with fellow participants, and participate in all the fun events they have lined up. I'd love to learn from others, share my own ideas, and maybe even find some like-minded folks to collaborate with in the future. Let's get this datathon started and make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Ella, a third-year student with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and innovation. I'm always on the lookout for ways to learn and grow, both academically and professionally. With a background in programming, I've dabbled in everything from cloud computing to natural language processing. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact in the world, and I believe this datathon is the perfect platform to achieve that. I'm all about the experience, and I'm super excited to meet fellow participants who share my enthusiasm and energy!
