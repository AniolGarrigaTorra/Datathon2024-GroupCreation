My objective for this datathon is to dive deeper into the world of data analysis and learn as much as I can. With three hackathons under my belt, I'm excited to challenge myself and improve my skills. I'm looking forward to working with new tools and languages, and exploring different approaches to problem-solving. I'm hoping to take away some tangible skills that I can apply to my studies and future projects. Hey there! I'm Isabela, a third-year student with a passion for learning and experimenting with new technologies. I've been involved in a few hackathons, which have given me a great foundation in programming. I'm always looking to dive deeper into new topics and explore their applications. During this datathon, I'm excited to broaden my horizons and learn new skills, particularly in data analysis. I'm all about tackling challenges head-on and seeing where the journey takes me. Let's get this started and see what innovative solutions we can create!
