My goal for this datathon is to connect with other like-minded folks and have a blast while doing it! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, sharing knowledge, and learning from one another. I'm not too concerned with winning, but more excited to dive into as many events and activities as possible. Let's keep things relaxed, and just enjoy the experience! I'm all about making new friendships and having an unforgettable time. Who knows, maybe we'll even discover some amazing innovations together - but at the end of the day, it's all about the vibe, not the trophy. Hey there! I'm Emily Wynter, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast and 4th-year student. I'm all about pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me building something cool or experimenting with cutting-edge tech. I'm really stoked to be here for this datathon - I'm looking forward to swapping knowledge, sharing laughs, and making some awesome connections. I'm not too hung up on winning; it's all about the journey, the vibes, and the friends I make along the way. Let's make this an unforgettable experience, together!
