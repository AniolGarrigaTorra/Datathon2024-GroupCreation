Hey! I'm Sophia, and for this datathon, I'm focusing on learning new things and improving my skills. I want to step out of my comfort zone and try new technologies, tools, and techniques. I'm hoping to dive deep into data visualization, machine learning, and data storytelling. I'm excited to learn from others, get feedback, and see how they approach problems. My goal is to come out of this datathon with a sense of accomplishment, feeling more confident in my abilities, and having gained valuable new skills and knowledge that I can apply to my studies and future projects. Hi! I'm Sophia. I'm a 19-year-old student taking steps to step out of my comfort zone. In the tech realm, I've dabbled in Natural Language Processing and data analysis - and I'm excited to dive deeper. With a keen eye on innovation and creativity, I'm eager to learn new technologies and tools. I'm a fan of sleek designs and strive to create visually appealing results. And, as an added bonus, I want to do some good with my newfound skills.
