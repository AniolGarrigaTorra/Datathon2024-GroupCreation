Hi! So, my main objective for this datathon is to focus on learning and improving my skills. As a second-year computer science student, I feel like I've been going through the motions in my classes, and I want to actually apply what I've learned to a real-world problem. I'm looking forward to working with others and getting mentored by experienced professionals to help me grow as a developer. I'm excited to learn new technologies, gain hands-on experience, and push my programming skills to the next level! Hey there! I'm Alejandro Morales, a 19-year-old computer science student looking to shake things up. I've been going through the motions in my classes, and I'm eager to apply my learning to real-world problems. I've had some experience with coding, and I'm always on the lookout for new ways to improve my skills. Outside of class, you can find me experimenting with design tools like Figma or dabbling in blockchain concepts. I'm excited to learn, collaborate, and level up as a developer during this datathon.
