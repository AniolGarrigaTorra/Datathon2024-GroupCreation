Hey there! I'm Camille, and for this datathon, my goal is to soak up as much knowledge as I can and level up my skills. I've had a few hackathon experiences under my belt, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm hoping to dive deeper into some specific areas, like data visualization and machine learning, and just generally improve my coding chops. I'm not super competitive, so winning isn't really a concern for me - I just want to get better and walk away with some new tricks and ideas to take back to my degree. Hey there! I'm Camille, a junior computer science major looking to dive deeper into the world of data. I've had a few hackathon experiences under my belt, but I know there's still so much to learn. My goal for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge as I can, specifically in areas like data visualization and machine learning. I'm excited to collaborate with others, improve my coding skills, and leave with new tricks and ideas to take back to my studies. Let's make this a learning adventure together!
