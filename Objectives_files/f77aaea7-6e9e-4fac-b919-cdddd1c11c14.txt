Hey! So, I'm really excited to be here at the datathon! My goal is to take this opportunity to improve my programming skills and learn from others. I've already got a solid foundation in coding, but I know there's always more to learn and I'm eager to dive deeper into new tools and techniques. I'm looking forward to collaborating with others, asking questions, and getting feedback to help me grow as a developer. I'm all about self-improvement, so expect me to be fully engaged and soaking up all the knowledge I can get! Hey there! I'm Aur√®lia, a 21-year-old student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I've spent the past two years honing my skills in programming, with a focus on machine learning and web development. I'm all about learning and growing as a developer, and I'm excited to be here at the datathon to take my skills to the next level. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over the latest AI breakthroughs or experimenting with new technologies. I'm looking forward to meeting like-minded people and sharing my enthusiasm for all things tech!
