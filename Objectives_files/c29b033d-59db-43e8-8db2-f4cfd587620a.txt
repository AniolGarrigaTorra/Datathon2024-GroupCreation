Hey, I'm Sofía! For this datathon, I'm all about making memories, not necessarily winning trophies. I'm hoping to meet fellow coding enthusiasts and have a blast while doing it. I'd love to participate in all the events, from workshops to hack challenges, and learn from my peers. I'm all about that team vibe, so if I can help make some new buddies along the way, that's the cherry on top! Hey! I'm Sofía Watts, an 18-year-old student diving into my second year of studying to make it in the tech world. I'm all about creating innovative solutions that make life easier and more fun. When I'm not stuck in textbooks, you can find me exploring new coding projects or chatting with fellow enthusiasts about the latest trends in AI, IoT, and Fintech. I'm super pumped to be here at the datathon, where I can collaborate with like-minded individuals, geek out over code, and create something that brings a smile to people's faces!
