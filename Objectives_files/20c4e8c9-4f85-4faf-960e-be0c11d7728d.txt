I'm all about having a blast and making new connections at this datathon! As a student, I don't have too much experience under my belt, so I'm more looking forward to taking in all the amazing workshops, attending talks, and participating in events that catch my eye. My goal is to walk out of here with a bunch of new friends who share similar passions and a ton of fun memories. I'm open to trying new things, learning from others, and just enjoying the whole experience. Bring on the data and the camaraderie! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 17-year-old student looking to explore the world of data and make some unforgettable memories along the way. I'm still in my first year of studying, and I'm excited to dive into the world of cybersecurity and technology. In my free time, I love immersing myself in AR/VR experiences and trying out new gaming platforms. I'm all about building connections and learning from others, so I'm stoked to be here and see what this datathon has in store!
