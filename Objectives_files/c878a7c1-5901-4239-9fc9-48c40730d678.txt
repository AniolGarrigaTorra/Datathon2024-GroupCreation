Hey there! So, what's my objective for this datathon? Honestly, I'm here to crush it and come out on top! I've got some solid skills under my belt from my two hackathons under my belt, and I'm aiming to put them to good use. I want to work my butt off to create the most innovative and impressive project, and ultimately, win this thing. I'm all about competition, and I'm willing to push myself to the limit to get there. Hi! I'm Evelyn, a 20-year-old student on a mission to make a difference. I'm all about pushing boundaries and exploring cutting-edge tech. With a passion for gaming and AR/VR, I love combining fun with function to create innovative solutions. As a second-year student, I've honed my programming skills and am excited to put them to the test. When I'm not coding, you can find me daydreaming about social impact projects or exploring new corners of the digital world. I'm ready to join forces, learn, and have a blast at this datathon!
