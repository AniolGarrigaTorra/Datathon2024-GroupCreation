Hi! I'm Aleixia, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon. For me, it's all about making new friends and having a blast! I want to soak up the energy of the event, learn new things along the way, and participate in as many cool activities as I can. I'm not super competitive, so I'm not looking to win or impress anyone. I just want to chat, collaborate, and have some laughs with the other participants. So, hit me up if you're looking for someone to hack, play games, or grab a coffee with - let's make this datathon an unforgettable experience! Hey there! I'm Aleixia, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! I'm a second-year student with a passion for using tech to make a positive impact. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me exploring the latest life hacks or diving into some fascinating quantum theories. I'm all about collaboration and making new friends, so I'm looking forward to meeting some awesome people and having an amazing time. Can't wait to get started and see what the next 24 hours bring!
