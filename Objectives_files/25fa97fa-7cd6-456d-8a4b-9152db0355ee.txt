Hi! My name is Alessia, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon. For me, it's all about leveling up my skills and learning new things. I've got a solid foundation in programming, but I want to dive deeper into machine learning and data science. I'm looking to improve my ability to think critically and creatively, and to expand my technical toolkit. I'm not too worried about winning, to be honest - I'm happy to spend my time digging into new challenges and learning from others. Bring on the data, and let's see what we can discover! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a third-year student with a passion for data-driven solutions. I've been dabbling in programming for a while now and I'm excited to level up my skills in machine learning and data science. I'm all about exploring innovative ways to use technology to make a difference. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with code, staying up-to-date with the latest trends, and collaborating with like-minded individuals. I'm a creative problem-solver with a strong dose of curiosity, and I'm ready to dive into this datathon with an open mind and a sense of adventure!
