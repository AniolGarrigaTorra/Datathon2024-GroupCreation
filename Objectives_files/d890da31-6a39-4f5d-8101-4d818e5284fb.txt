Hey! So, I'm all about chill vibes and good company. My main goal for this datathon is to have an amazing time and make some new buddies! I'd love to participate in all the events and workshops, not just the coding challenges. Maybe I'll even stumble upon some inspiring talks or hacky-happy hackathons I've never tried before. If I happen to pick up some new skills or learn something rad along the way, that's just the icing on the cake. Most importantly, I'm here to laugh, have fun, and create some unforgettable memories with fellow datathon enthusiasts! Hey everyone! I'm Sol√®ne, a third-year student with a love for all things digital. I've dabbled in programming for a bit and I'm eager to keep learning and exploring new frontiers. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming to some sick beats or indulging in some tasty snacks. I'm all about creating good vibes and having an amazing time. This datathon is going to be an incredible opportunity for me to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, soak up some knowledge, and have a blast! I'm stoked to be here and see what the weekend brings!
