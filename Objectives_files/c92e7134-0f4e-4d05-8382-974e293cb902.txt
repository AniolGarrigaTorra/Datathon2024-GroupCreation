My objective for this datathon is to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to level up my skills and learn as much as I can. I've attended five hackathons before, but I've always had a 'jack-of-all-trades' approach, trying to learn a little of everything but never really mastering any specific skill. I want to focus on improving my Python skills, exploring data visualization tools like Tableau, and learning some machine learning techniques. I'm excited to dive deeper into these areas and leave this datathon feeling more confident and prepared for future coding challenges. Hi everyone! I'm Aura, a third-year student with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me diving into the world of coding. I've had my fair share of hackathons, but I've always taken a generalist approach, leaving me with a thirst for deeper knowledge. I'm thrilled to be here, where I can focus on honing my skills and exploring new technologies. I'm all about continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited to see where this datathon takes me.
