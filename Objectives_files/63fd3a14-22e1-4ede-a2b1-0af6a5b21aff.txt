I'm all about having a blast at this datathon! I want to soak up the vibes, meet new people, and learn from the amazing organizers and attendees. I'm not super competitive, so my goal isn't to win (although that would be awesome too!). I'm really looking forward to participating in as many events as possible, attending workshops, and just generally having a good time. Bring on the team-building activities, game nights, and impromptu hack sessions - that's where the magic happens for me! Hi there! I'm Llu√≠s, a 20-year-old student currently in my second year of studies. I'm all about embracing new experiences and making the most out of my time. I'm really stoked to be a part of this datathon, where I can meet new people, learn from experts, and have a blast while doing it. My approach is all about having a good time, being open to new ideas, and soaking up the energy of the community. I'm excited to get involved in team-building activities, workshops, and maybe even sneak in some impromptu learning. Let's make this a memorable event!
