Hey, I'm Aurora! For this datathon, my objective is to make the most of the experience and connect with fellow participants. I want to soak up new skills and knowledge, but also make sure to have a blast while doing it! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, attending awesome events, and just enjoying the vibe of the datathon. Winning's cool and all, but for me, it's all about having an amazing time and taking away lifelong memories. Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 2nd-year student with a passion for combining art and tech. When I'm not studying, you can catch me jamming to my favorite tunes or getting creative with digital art. I'm excited to dive into this datathon and level up my skills in programming and data analysis. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow participants and making the most of this experience. My objective is to have an amazing time, learn from the best, and maybe even discover some new hidden talents along the way. Let's make some memories and get started on this exciting adventure together!
