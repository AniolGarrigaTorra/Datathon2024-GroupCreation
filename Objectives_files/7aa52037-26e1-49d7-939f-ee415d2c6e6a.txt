Hey, my objective for this datathon is to dive deep into learning new techniques and improving my skills. As a 3rd-year student with 6 hackathons under my belt, I'm eager to push my limits and explore more advanced concepts. I want to challenge myself, troubleshoot, and experiment with different approaches to gain a deeper understanding of data science. I'm looking forward to working with talented individuals, sharing knowledge, and learning from each other's experiences. Let's level up our skills together! Hey there! I'm Amita, a 20-year-old student with a passion for programming and solving real-world problems. I've been part of six hackathons, and I'm always up for a challenge. As a third-year student, I've got a solid foundation in programming, but I'm eager to dive deeper into data science. I'm a fan of exploring new tech trends, and I'm excited to level up my skills with like-minded individuals. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying out new life hacks or researching innovative solutions to social issues. Let's get creative and see what we can build together!
