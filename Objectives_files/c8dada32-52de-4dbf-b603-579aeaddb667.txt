Hey! I'm Cristina, a junior student with a thirst for knowledge. My main goal for this datathon is to learn and improve my programming skills as much as possible. I've had some experience with programming, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm excited to dive in and experiment with new tools and techniques. I'm not looking to win, but rather to gain new insights and perspectives from other participants. I want to leave this datathon with a sense of accomplishment, having learned something valuable and making progress in my programming journey. Hey everyone! I'm Cristina, a junior student with a passion for learning. I'm relatively new to the world of programming, but I'm excited to dive in and soak up as much knowledge as I can during this datathon. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to make technology more interactive and engaging, and I'm curious to see how programming can help me get there. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow coders and mentors, and gaining insights from their experiences. Bring on the challenges and let's learn together!
