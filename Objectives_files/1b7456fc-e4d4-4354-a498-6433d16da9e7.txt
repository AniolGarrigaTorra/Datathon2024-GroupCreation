I'm Sofía, and I'm all about coming out on top. My objective for this datathon is to give it my all and try to win. I'm not here just to have a good time (although that's going to happen too!), I'm here to learn and absorb as much as I can, and use that knowledge to crush it in the competition. I'm looking forward to working with my teammates, learning from the judges, and doing everything I can to take home that first prize. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Sofía, a third-year student with a passion for all things tech. When I'm not stuck in the library, I love tinkering with code and exploring how I can use it to make a positive impact. For this datathon, I'm all about giving it my all and learning as much as I can. I've dabbled in blockchain and data analysis, and I'm excited to dive deeper into these topics. Bring on the challenge - I'm ready to push myself and see what I can achieve with my new teammates!
