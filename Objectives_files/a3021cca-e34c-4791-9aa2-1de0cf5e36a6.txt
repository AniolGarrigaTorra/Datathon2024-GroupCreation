Hey! I'm excited to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to have a blast, meet new people, and try as many different things as possible. I'm not too worried about winning, as my coding skills are still a work in progress. I'm more about soaking up the energy, learning from others, and enjoying the ride. I'd love to try out new tools, attend cool workshops, and just hang out with other participants. Let's do this, and make some amazing memories along the way! Hey, I'm Merc√®! I'm a 22-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I've been dabbling in coding for a few years now, and I'm always excited to try new things. I'm not a super experienced coder, but I love the feeling of building something from scratch. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to music, drawing, or experimenting with lifehacks. I'm super social and love meeting new people, which is why I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon. Let's get this creative energy party started!
