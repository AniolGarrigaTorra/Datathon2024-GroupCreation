Hey there! I'm Sophia, and for this datathon, my goal is to chill and have a blast with fellow participants! I don't expect to win or worry too much about results. I just want to soak up the experience, learn something new (but not too many tears over coding woes, and mingle with awesome people like me who love data and tech. I'm looking forward to exploring the venue, attending workshops, and jamming with fellow coders. Let's make this an unforgettable datathon and make some awesome memories together! Hey everyone! I'm Sophia, an 18-year-old student with a passion for data and technology. I'm always excited to learn new things, especially when it comes to making the world a better place. I enjoy trying out different tools and languages, from developing mobile apps to exploring the world of virtual reality. I'm looking forward to this datathon, where I hope to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts and make some amazing memories. Don't worry, I won't be taking myself too seriously - I'm all about having fun and making the most of this experience!
