Hey! As a participant, my goal is to push my limits and level up my skills. I'm excited to learn from others and explore new tools and technologies. I'm not aiming for a specific rank or prize, but rather to take away valuable insights and experiences that'll help me grow as a developer. I'd love to get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to tackle complex problems. Bring on the tough puzzles and coding obstacles - it's time to upgrade my skills and be a better programmer by the end of this datathon! Hey, I'm Rina! I'm a 22-year-old student with a passion for coding and learning. I'm entering the datathon to level up my skills, push my limits, and explore new technologies.
