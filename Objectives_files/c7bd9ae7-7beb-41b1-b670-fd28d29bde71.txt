Hey! So, for this datathon, my objective is to really push my skills to the next level. I've been coding for a few years now, but I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface. I'm hoping to get hands-on experience with new tools, frameworks, and techniques. I want to challenge myself to tackle more complex problems and figure out ways to optimize my workflow. Most importantly, I want to learn from others and grow as a developer. For me, the thrill of datathons isn't about winning, it's about growth and self-improvement. Bring on the challenges! Hey there! I'm Madeleine, a 21-year-old student with a passion for pushing the boundaries of coding. With a few years of experience under my belt, I'm now eager to take my skills to the next level. I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities of emerging technologies and the impact they can have on society. My goal for this datathon is to learn from others, tackle complex problems, and refine my workflow. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow developers, learn new techniques, and grow as a coder. Can't wait to dive in and see what awesome projects we can create!
