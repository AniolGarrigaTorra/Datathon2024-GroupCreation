I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon! My objective is to make the most of this amazing opportunity by focusing on having fun, meeting new people, and taking part in as many events as possible. I want to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone and try new things, but also enjoy the experience with my fellow participants. Whether it's learning something new, working on a fun project, or just enjoying the atmosphere, I'm ready to soak it all in and make some unforgettable memories! Hey everyone, I'm Luz Amaryllis Carson, a first-year student with a thirst for adventure and a love for learning. I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon! Outside of academics, I enjoy tinkering with tech and design - I find it fascinating how the two worlds collide. I'm eager to challenge myself, make new friends, and have a blast while doing it. I'm all about stepping out of my comfort zone, taking risks, and having those 'wow, I did that!' moments. Can't wait to see what this datathon has in store!
