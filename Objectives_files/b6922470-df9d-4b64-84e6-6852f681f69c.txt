Hey, so I'm approaching this datathon as a learning experience. I want to come out the other side with some new skills under my belt and a deeper understanding of the tech. I'm all about leveling up and I know that this datathon is a great opportunity to push myself out of my comfort zone. I'd love to learn from the organizers and other participants, and see how my project evolves over the weekend. For me, it's all about growth and improvement - if we happen to create something amazing in the process, that's just a bonus! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 21-year-old computer science student eager to learn and grow at this datathon. I'm all about embracing the unknown and trying new things, which is why I'm super stoked to be here. With a background in computer vision and machine learning, I'm excited to combine my technical skills with my creative passions, like music and art. I'm looking forward to collaborating with others, pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and taking home some new skills and knowledge. Let's make something amazing together!
