Hey! So, I'm Elena, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon. I'm not really competitive, to be honest, I've done one hackathon and it was more of a struggle than fun. This time, I just want to chill, learn some new things, and meet new people! I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, attend some workshops, and maybe even squeeze in a few team-building activities. My goal is to leave here with some new friends and some awesome stories to tell. Let's have fun and create something awesome together! Hey everyone, I'm Elena! I'm a student, and I'm thrilled to be here at the datathon. I've always been fascinated by how tech can shape the world and make a positive impact. I've got a solid foundation in programming, and I love tinkering with new projects. My ideal project is one that brings people together and makes life easier. I'm all about collaboration and learning from others, so I'm excited to meet new people and pick up some new skills. Let's have a blast and make something amazing together!
