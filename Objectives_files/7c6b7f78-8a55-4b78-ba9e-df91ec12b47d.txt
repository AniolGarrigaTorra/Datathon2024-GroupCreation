Hey! I'm Luna, and for this datathon, I'm super excited to learn and improve my skills! As a 3rd-year student, I'm always looking to step up my programming game and take on new challenges. I've participated in 5 hackathons before, but I never felt like I'd truly mastered a project. This time, I want to dive deeper into specific topics like machine learning and NLP. My goal is to come away from this datathon with some tangible skills and knowledge that I can apply to my academic and personal projects. Bring on the coding! Hey there! I'm Luna, a 21-year-old university student with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. I've been tinkering with programming for a while now, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to sharpen my skills. I'm a bit of a polymath, with a curious nature that leads me to dabble in everything from mobile app development to voice skills and DevOps. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to learn from others, grow as a developer, and take my coding skills to the next level. Bring it on!
