Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to maximize my learning experience and improve my skills in data manipulation and analysis. As a beginner, I want to take this opportunity to absorb as much knowledge as possible, learn from experienced individuals, and step out of my comfort zone. I'm excited to dive deeper into data visualization, machine learning, and maybe even try my hand at Python scripting! My goal is to level up my skills, not necessarily to win, but to become a more confident and capable data enthusiast by the end of the event. Hi! I'm Elodie, a 20-year-old student looking to learn and grow through this datathon. I've got a curious mind and a love for programming, which I've been studying for a bit now. I've had some experience with web development and Rust, and I've dabbled in JavaScript. What I'm most excited about is diving deeper into data analysis and visualization - it's like solving a puzzle, and I'm all in! I'm not competing to win; I want to take home new skills, challenge myself, and meet like-minded folks along the way. Can't wait to get started!
