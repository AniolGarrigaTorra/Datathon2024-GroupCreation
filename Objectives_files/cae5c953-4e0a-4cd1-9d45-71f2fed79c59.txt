My objective for this datathon is straightforward - I'm here to win! With three hackathons under my belt, I'm looking to put my skills to the test and take home the top prize. I've worked hard to develop my programming skills and I'm confident in my ability to tackle complex challenges. I'll be dedicating all my time and energy to solving problems, collaborating with others, and coming up with innovative solutions. It's going to be tough, but I'm ready to give it my all and prove myself as a serious contender. Hey there! I'm Alessia, a third-year student with a passion for making a real impact. I've honed my programming skills through hackathons and personal projects, and I'm always looking for a new challenge. Outside of coding, you can find me jamming out to music, sketching art, or staying active with a sports team. My goal is to use technology to make a difference in the world - whether it's through improving health, fostering social good, or just plain old making life easier. When I'm not coding, I'm always ready for the next adventure!
