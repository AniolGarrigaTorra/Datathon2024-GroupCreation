Hey, I'm Lola! My goal for this datathon is to come out on top - literally! I've had a taste of the thrill of competing in three hackathons, and I'm hungry for more. I want to push myself to be the best I can be, to stay up late pouring over code and testing my skills against others. My objective is to win, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way. I'm ready to put in the hard work and grind it out to claim that top spot. Hey everyone, I'm Lola! I'm a third-year student with a thirst for adventure and a passion for coding. I've caught the competitive bug, having participated in three hackathons so far. For this datathon, I'm all about aiming high - literally! My goal is to take the top spot, and I'm willing to put in the late-night coding sessions to get there. When I'm not building something, you can find me geeking out over the latest dev tools or tinkering with my latest project. Bring on the challenge!
