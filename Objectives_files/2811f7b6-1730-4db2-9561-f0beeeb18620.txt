My objective for this datathon is to level up my skills and take my programming abilities to the next level. I'm not here to just show off, but to challenge myself and push my limits. I'm excited to dive into new technologies, tools, and techniques, and apply them to real-world problems. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other passionate developers and learning from each other. Ultimately, I want to walk away from this datathon with a newfound confidence and a toolbox full of fresh skills to take back to my studies and future projects. Hey there! I'm Sofia Rodriguez, a 21-year-old student with a passion for coding. I've been hooked on programming since high school, and I'm always looking for ways to level up my skills. I'm a firm believer that coding shouldn't be just about building apps, but about making a positive impact on the world. This datathon is an opportunity for me to challenge myself, collaborate with like-minded developers, and explore new technologies that can help me achieve my goal of creating meaningful solutions. I'm excited to be here and can't wait to see what we'll create together!
