My objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into the challenges and learn as much as I can. I'm eager to step out of my comfort zone and tackle new problem-solving approaches, language learning, or data visualization techniques. I've had experience at hackathons, but I want to take my skills to the next level. I'm looking to gain practical knowledge, get familiar with new tools and frameworks, and polish my coding skills. I'm excited to collaborate with others and learn from their strengths and experiences - let the datathon be a valuable learning experience! Hi, I'm Em√≠lia! I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems through data and code. I've been coding since high school and have experience with various programming languages and tools. Outside of class, I enjoy dabbling in AI and ML, as well as exploring the possibilities of quantum computing. My goal for this datathon is to step out of my comfort zone and learn as much as I can from this incredible opportunity. I'm excited to meet fellow participants and mentors who share my enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving. Let's learn and grow together!
