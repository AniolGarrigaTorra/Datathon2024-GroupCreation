As a beginner programmer, I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! My goal is to improve my skills and learn new things. I'd love to dive deep into data analysis and visualization, and explore how I can apply it to real-world problems. I'm open to trying out new tools and techniques, and even make mistakes along the way. I hope to leave this event with a fresh perspective, new insights, and a solid foundation to build upon. Hey there! I'm Sabrina, a 17-year-old beginner programmer on a quest to improve my skills and learn something new.
