Here's my brief objective:

For me, this datathon is about having an amazing time with like-minded folks! I'm all about making new friends, learning from them, and sharing laughs together. I want to soak up every moment, participate in as many events as I can, and just have a blast. Winning is important, but not my top priority. I'd love to take away some new skills and connections, but mostly, I just want to have the best time possible with my new datathon family. Sounds like a dream come true to me! Hey there! I'm Aurora, and I'm super excited to be part of this amazing datathon! As a 4th-year student, I'm always looking for ways to expand my horizons and learn from others. I have a passion for fintech, security, and technology that makes a difference in people's lives. You can find me cozied up with a good cuppa, digging through code, or experimenting with new project ideas. I'm all about collaboration, laughter, and making unforgettable memories. Let's grab this opportunity to create something incredible and have an absolute blast while doing it!
