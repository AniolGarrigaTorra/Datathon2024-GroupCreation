Here's my objective:

For me, this datathon is all about soaking up the experience and having a blast! I'm excited to meet new people who share similar passions, learn from their expertise, and grow as a programmer together. I'm not really concerned about winning, I'd rather focus on participating in all the activities, attending workshops, and exploring new tools and technologies. I'm looking forward to laughing with my teammates, learning from our mistakes, and having an awesome time while making memories with fellow datathoners! Hey there! I'm Maria Sol√©, a 21-year-old student living for the thrill of data exploration. I'm pumped to be part of this datathon, where I can dive into new tools, collaborate with fellow coders, and build memories that last. When I'm not studying, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes or curating my artistic side. I'm all about embracing the unknown and learning from my mistakes, so expect an unapologetically authentic participant this weekend. Let's get this datathon started!
