My objective for this datathon is to make the most out of this experience and learn as much as I can. I'm still new to programming and I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of data science. I want to challenge myself to try new things, experiment with different tools, and learn from my mistakes. My goal is to improve my skills and come out of this event with a better understanding of data science and a bunch of new ideas to apply to my studies. I'm excited to collaborate with others and soak up all the knowledge I can! Hey, I'm Ana! I'm a 17-year-old student diving into the world of programming. I'm still a beginner, but I'm passionate about learning and experimenting. I've recently discovered the world of data science and I'm excited to see what I can create with it. For me, this datathon is about pushing myself to try new things, make mistakes, and learn from them. I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and gaining a better understanding of data science. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me gaming or exploring my fascination with technology and its potential to change the world!
