Hey! My objective for this datathon is super chill - I just wanna have a blast! I'm all about making new friends and having fun, and I'm not too concerned about winning or toppling anyone else's records. I'll try my best, but at the end of the day, I just want to participate in as many events as I can, attend cool talks, and vibe with fellow datathon participants. I'm all about building connections and memories, so let's get this datathon started! Hey there! I'm Alessia Englishelli, a third-year student by day and coding enthusiast by night. I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon, where I get to chill with fellow tech-lovers and level up my skills. When I'm not binge-ing on coding tutorials, you can find me jamming out to tunes or geeking out over cybersecurity. My goal here is to soak up as much knowledge as I can, make some amazing connections, and have a blast while doing it. Ready to crush this datathon and have the time of my life!
