As a student, I'm all about continuous learning, and this datathon presents an incredible opportunity to level up my skills. My goal is to dive deep into new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies, and come out of this event feeling more confident and knowledgeable. I'm looking to learn from others, explore real-world problems, and maybe even stumble upon a new area of interest. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, learning from industry experts, or simply pushing myself to think outside the box, I'm excited to absorb as much as I can and return to my studies with new tools and perspectives! Hey there! I'm Aurora Ferran Langley, a 22-year-old student enthusiast. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to level up my skills and knowledge. I'm all about continuous learning, and I believe that's the key to staying ahead in the fast-paced tech world. Outside of academics, I'm a fan of databases and enterprise solutions, and I've always been intrigued by the potential of robotic process automation. I'm looking forward to meeting other talented individuals and sharing our collective passion for tech!
