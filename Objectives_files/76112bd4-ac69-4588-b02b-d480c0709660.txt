I'm all about making this datathon an unforgettable experience! My main goal is to meet fellow data enthusiasts, build new friendships, and have a blast together. I'm excited to participate in as many events as I can, whether it's a coding challenge, workshop, or even just a casual game night. I'm not too competitive about winning, and instead, I want to focus on learning new skills and having fun with the community. Bring on the adventure! Hi everyone! I'm Ava, a 17-year-old student with a passion for combining tech with creativity. I'm all about making the most of this datathon experience and forging new friendships. While I'm still a beginner in programming, I'm eager to learn and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. Outside of coding, you can find me exploring design, robotics, and AR/VR. For me, it's not just about winning - it's about having a blast, learning new skills, and making unforgettable memories with the community. Let's make this datathon one to remember!
