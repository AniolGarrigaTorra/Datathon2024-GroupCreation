Hey! I'm Sara, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! My goal is to have an amazing time making new friends and connections, learning some new skills (but not too much stress!), and participating in as many fun events as possible. I want to get that creative energy flowing, think outside the box, and have an overall awesome experience with awesome people. I'm all about positivity, creativity, and having fun! Hi everyone! I'm Sara, an 18-year-old first-year student looking to spice up my college experience at this datathon! I'm super excited to meet fellow enthusiasts, make new friends, and learn new skills (but without stressing out). I'm all about fostering creativity, having a blast, and learning how to think outside the box. I'm passionate about health, the arts, and exploring the latest technologies - like AR and VR - which is what led me to this amazing event! I'm eager to participate in various fun activities, mingle, and have an amazing time!
