My objective is clear: I'm here to win. With three hackathons under my belt, I'm feeling confident in my skills, but I know that competitive spirit always requires a boost. I'm looking to outdo myself and take home the top prize. I'll focus on cracking complex problems, pushing myself to learn new techniques, and forming strong partnerships with my teammates. The thrill of victory is my driving force, and I won't settle for anything less. Bring on the challenge! Hi, I'm Luna! I'm a 20-year-old third-year student with a drive to succeed. With three hackathons under my belt, I've got a hunger for competition and a love for solving complex problems. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or building projects in my free time. I'm all about being hands-on and collaborative - I know that's where the magic happens. I'm here to bring my A-game, make new connections, and maybe just snag that top prize. Let's do this!
