Hey, I'm Astrid! As a data enthusiast, I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon. My goal is to learn as much as possible, refine my skills, and expand my knowledge in programming and data analysis. I'm not looking to crush the competition, but instead, focus on diving deep into the project and pushing myself to become better at extracting insights from data. If I can also make some new friends and have a blast along the way, that's just icing on the cake! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a third-year student with a passion for combining technology and innovation. When I'm not in class, you can find me exploring the world of programming, database management, or designing user-friendly interfaces. I'm thrilled to be a part of this datathon, where I hope to learn, collaborate, and push my limits as a data enthusiast. My goal is to dive deep into the project, uncover hidden insights, and maybe even make some new friends along the way! Looking forward to meeting you all and seeing what amazing things we can achieve together!
