Hey there! I'm Solène, and I'm all about bringing home the gold. My objective for this datathon is to put everything on the line and push myself to be the best. I've participated in four hackathons before, and I've learned a thing or two about what it takes to win. I'm looking to use my existing skills and learn new ones to develop a game-changing project. I want to immerse myself in the data realm, absorb as much as I can, and come out on top with a prize-worthy idea. Expect to see me sprinting towards the finish line with a grin on my face! Hey there! I'm Solène, a third-year student with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I've participated in four hackathons so far and I'm eager to take it to the next level. I'm all about leveraging technology to make a real impact, especially in the health and retail sectors. When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in new AR/VR experiences or brainstorming with friends. This datathon is my chance to shine, to learn new skills and push myself to be the best. Get ready for a competitive and creative battle, and I hope to see you there!
