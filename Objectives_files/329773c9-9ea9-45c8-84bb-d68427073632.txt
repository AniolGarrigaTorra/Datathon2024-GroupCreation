As I sit down at my datathon workstation, I'm all about learning and leveling up my skills. My goal for the weekend is to dive deep into some new programming languages and tools, and come out the other side with some fresh techniques to add to my toolkit. I'm eager to tackle some challenging projects and work alongside fellow coders to learn from their experiences and share my own. I'm hoping to leave the datathon with a stronger sense of foundation in my coding abilities and some awesome new projects to show off to my peers! Hey there! I'm Ava Langston, a 20-year-old college student on a mission to supercharge my coding skills. I'm all about learning new tricks and leveling up my game, so the datathon is the perfect opportunity for me. I've dabbled in a few programming languages and have a passion for using tech to make things more efficient and secure. When I'm not buried in code, I love to help others communicate effectively. I'm excited to meet fellow coders and swap stories of troubleshooting and innovation.
