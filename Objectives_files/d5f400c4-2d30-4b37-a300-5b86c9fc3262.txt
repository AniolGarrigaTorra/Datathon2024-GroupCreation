My objective for this datathon is to make unforgettable memories with fellow participants! I'm stoked to soak up the fun atmosphere, attend awesome workshops, and learn from industry experts. I'm looking forward to jamming with my new datathon buddies, sharing laughs and solving problems together. While I'll definitely give it my best shot, my primary focus is on enjoying this crazy-cool experience and growing my network of like-minded individuals. I'm sure to come out of this datathon with new skills, memories, and friendships that'll last a lifetime - that's all the treasure I need! Hey there! I'm Aleixia Rose, a 2nd-year student with a thirst for innovation and learning. When I'm not buried in books, I'm often tinkering with tech to bring my ideas to life. This datathon is all about enjoying the ride, meeting awesome people, and gaining new perspectives. As a programmer with a passion for AI and cybersecurity, I'm stoked to soak up knowledge from industry experts and jam with my new buddies. I'm a bit goofy, a bit curious, and always up for an adventure. Let's make some unforgettable memories together!
