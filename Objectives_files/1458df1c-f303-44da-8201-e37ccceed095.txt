Hang loose! As a data enthusiast, I'm looking to make some amazing connections and have an absolute blast at this datathon! My goal is to mingle with other like-minded individuals, participate in as many events as I can, and soak up as much fun as possible. I'm all about leveling up my skills, sure, but for now, I just want to enjoy the ride, learn some new things, and make new BFFs in the data sphere. Let's grab some data and laughter together! Hey there! I'm Ana Sofia Elliot, a 19-year-old student with a passion for tech and all things data. I'm currently in my second year of studying, and I've been hooked on programming since I learned to code. When I'm not in class, you can find me experimenting with new technologies or scouring the web for the latest lifehacks. I'm stoked to be here at the datathon, where I'm looking forward to meeting like-minded people and having an absolute blast! Can't wait to grab some fun and knowledge along the way.
