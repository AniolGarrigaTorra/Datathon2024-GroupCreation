I'm super competitive and I'm here to win! My objective is to use my programming skills to craft the most innovative and useful data-driven solution. I want to dominate the leaderboard and be crowned the ultimate champion. I'm going to put in the long hours, dig deep into the data, and push myself to the limit to ensure I've submitted the best project possible. Bring it on, I'm ready for this! My goal is to win, period. Hey, I'm Ava Emerson Wright, a 19-year-old student with a passion for building innovative solutions. I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to drive positive change. With a background in programming and a keen interest in social good, I'm all about crafting practical applications that make a difference. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming, rock climbing, or experimenting with new coding languages. For this datathon, I'm putting my programming skills to the test, aiming to create a game-changing project that takes home the top prize!
