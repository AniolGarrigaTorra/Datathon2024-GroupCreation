Hey! I'm Léa, and my goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and knowledge. I'm excited to dive into new tools, technologies, and methods that will help me grow as a programmer. I'm all about experimentation and creativity, so I'm looking forward to pushing myself out of my comfort zone and taking on new challenges. I'm eager to learn from fellow participants, instructors, and any new opportunities that come my way. I'm not too focused on the competitive aspect - I just want to absorb as much as I can and walk away with a newfound sense of technical expertise! Hey there! I'm Léa Dupont, a fourth-year student with a passion for learning and creating. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me experimenting with new technologies and exploring innovative ways to make a difference. I'm excited to join the datathon and level up my skills in a dynamic environment. I'm all about collaboration, creativity, and taking calculated risks. I'm looking forward to pushing myself out of my comfort zone, soaking up new knowledge, and meeting like-minded folks along the way. Let's get this datathon started and make something amazing together!
