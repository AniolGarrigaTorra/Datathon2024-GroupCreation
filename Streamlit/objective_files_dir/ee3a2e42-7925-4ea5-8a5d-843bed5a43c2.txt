Hi! I'm Aurora, and my objective for this datathon is to crush it and take home the top prize! With my 2 hackathon participations under my belt, I'm determined to put my beginner programming skills to the test and really show what I'm capable of. I'm looking forward to a challenging competition that will push me to learn new tech and coding tricks, and of course, outsmart my fellow competitors to stand on that winners' podium. I'm ready to put in the long hours and put everything I've got into it - the best, the win, and the fame! Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 2nd-year student with a passion for making a digital impact. I've dabbled in coding and joined a few hackathons to get a taste of the competition and learn some new tricks. My friends call me a problem-solver, and I'm always up for a challenge. In my free time, you can find me sketching out design ideas or producing beats on my laptop. I'm ready to test my skills against the best and bring home the top prize - it's time to put everything I've got into this datathon!
