Hey, I'm Lorenza! For this datathon, I'm all about the win. I want to give it my all and make sure I'm one of the top contenders. I've had some experience with programming and hacking from my one hackathon back in the day, and I'm confident that my skills can take me far. I'm all about competitive spirit and want to push myself to see how well I can do. My goal is to learn from the other participants and judges, but ultimately, my main focus is on getting that top prize! Hey there! I'm Lorenza, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon. I'm a 3rd-year student with a passion for competitive coding and creative problem-solving. With a background in hacking and some experience under my belt, I'm always looking for a challenge to push myself to new heights. I love the thrill of working with data and bringing innovative ideas to life. My goal is to learn from the best and have a blast while doing it. Bring it on, datathon!
