Hey! As a 19-year-old student, I'm super excited to be participating in the datathon. My goal is to make the most of this experience by meeting new people, having an amazing time, and taking part in as many events as I can. I'm all about exploring new skills, trying out different tools, and learning from others, but at the end of the day, I want to leave with a ton of memories and new friendships. I'm ready to be my awesome, friendly self and see where the weekend takes me! Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Aurora Santiago, a 19-year-old student diving into my second year of university. When I'm not crunching away at my books, you can find me indulging in my love for music, art, and gaming. I'm all about staying curious and learning new tricks, which is why I'm super stoked to be here for the datathon. I'm a social butterfly looking to connect with like-minded folks and soak up as much as I can from this awesome experience. Let's have an amazing weekend and create some unforgettable memories together!
