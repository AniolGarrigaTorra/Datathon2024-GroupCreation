I'm coming for the win! As a seasoned hackathon veteran, I've got the skills and drive to take the top spot. My goal is to focus on coding, problem-solving, and collaborating with my teammates to create a revolutionary project that stands out from the crowd. I'm willing to put in the extra effort to learn new techniques, push my limits, and grind out any bugs to deliver a polished product. I'm ready to take the challenge and come out on top. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Alonso Eduardo Weber, a third-year student with a passion for taking on new challenges. I've been involved in a few hackathons before, but I'm not done yet - I'm aiming for the top spot this time around. I love getting my hands dirty with coding and collaborating with like-minded folks to create something innovative. With a knack for UI/UX design and a knack for problem-solving, I'm excited to see what our team can come up with this weekend. Let's do this and take our projects to the next level!
