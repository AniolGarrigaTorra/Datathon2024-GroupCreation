You know what? I'm all about making the most out of this datathon experience! My goal is to have a blast, make new friends, and participate in as many events as possible. I want to soak up the vibes, learn a thing or two (without stressing too much about the techy stuff), and have unforgettable moments with like-minded people. If someone lands a prize, that's awesome, but my priority is about the connections I make, the stories I hear, and the memories we create. Let's do this, datathon squad! Hey there! I'm Isabella, a 21-year-old student with a passion for making the most out of life! I'm in my fourth year of studying and loving every minute of it. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm usually tinkering with new tech tools or geeking out over design. I'm all about productivity, finding creative solutions to everyday problems, and using tech to improve our daily lives. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, looking forward to connecting with fellow datathoners and having an amazing time!
