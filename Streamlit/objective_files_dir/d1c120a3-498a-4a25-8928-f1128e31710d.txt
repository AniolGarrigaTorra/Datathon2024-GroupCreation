I'm all about going in to win. My main objective is to crush the competition and take home that top prize. I've been to five hackathons before and I know what it takes to come out on top. I've got a solid foundation in programming and I'm ready to bring my A-game to this datathon. My goal is to outsmart and outwork everyone else and be the last one standing. I'm not interested in half-baked projects or just showing up for the free food - I want to bring a solution that's innovative, scalable, and a game-changer. Expect tough competition from me! Hi, I'm Ling! I'm a 20-year-old third-year student with a passion for building innovative solutions. In my free time, you can find me coding up a storm or gaming with my friends. With a solid foundation in programming, I've got my sights set on winning this datathon. I'm all about crafting game-changing projects that can scale and make a real impact. I'm not afraid to put in the hard work and long hours to get the job done. I'm excited to see what this datathon has in store and to give it my all to take home that top prize!
