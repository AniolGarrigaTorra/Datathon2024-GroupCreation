As someone who's participated in a couple of hackathons, I've gotten a taste of the thrill of competition and winning. For this datathon, my objective is clear: I'm here to win. I want to challenge myself, push my limits, and outdo my fellow competitors. I'm eager to sink my teeth into the challenges and come out on top. My main goal is to have the most innovative solution that solves the problem, and I'm willing to put in the extra effort to make it happen. Bring it on, I'm ready to take it all! Hey there! I'm Ana Pujol, a second-year student with a thirst for competition and innovation. I've dabbled in coding and participated in a few hackathons, but I'm eager to take it to the next level. I'm all about pushing boundaries, solving complex problems, and creating something truly remarkable. For this datathon, I'm bringing my A-game, ready to challenge myself and others. Expect intense focus, creative thinking, and a dash of fun - I'm looking forward to getting my hands dirty and walking away with an unforgettable experience and prize!
