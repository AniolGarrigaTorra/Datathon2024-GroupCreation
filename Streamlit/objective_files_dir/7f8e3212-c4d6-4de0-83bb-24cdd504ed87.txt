Hi! So, my main objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into new concepts, tools, and techniques. As a 2nd-year undergrad with limited but growing programming skills, I'm super keen to level up my skills and expand my knowledge in the realm of data analysis. I'm not aiming to win or just focus on networking (although, let's be real, those are important too). My main goal is to immerse myself in as many workshops, sessions, and projects as possible and walk away with some serious learnin' and skill-blastin' under my belt! Hey! I'm Sof√≠a Anne Thompson, a second-year undergrad with a curious streak and a passion for learning. As a beginner in programming, I'm looking to level up and explore the world of data analysis. I've dabbled in UI/UX design and React, and I'm excited to apply these skills in new and innovative ways. Outside of coding, I'm a fan of solving real-world problems and staying on the cutting edge of tech trends. I'm all about being a lifelong learner, and I'm stoked to be a part of this datathon and see where it takes me!
