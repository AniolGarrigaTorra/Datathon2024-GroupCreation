Hey, I'm Sophie! My objective for this datathon is to crush it and win - plain and simple. I'm a total beginner when it comes to programming, but I'm a competitive soul and I love a good challenge. I've got this fire burning inside me to prove to myself that I can actually do something amazing, and what better way to do that than by beating the odds and taking home the prize? I'm ready to put in the extra hours, stay focused, and give it my all to win this thing! Hey there! I'm Sophie, a 19-year-old student with a passion for solving problems and making a difference. I'm new to the world of programming, but I'm eager to learn and prove to myself that I've got what it takes to make an impact. I'm all about challenging myself and pushing beyond my limits. Outside of academics, I love exploring innovative technologies like AR/VR and finding ways to use them to drive social good. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to apply my skills and show what I'm capable of. Let's get this done!
