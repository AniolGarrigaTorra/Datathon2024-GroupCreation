My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this unique opportunity to meet fellow enthusiasts and have a blast together! I'm not too concerned about coming out on top or showing off my skills. I just want to immerse myself in the community, learn as much as I can in the midst of all the hustle and bustle, and get to know the other participants on a more personal level. I'd love to attend workshops, join brainstorming sessions, and just soak up the energy of being around like-minded people. If I can do all that while having fun, I'll consider my weekend a total success! Hey there! I'm Sofia Casanovas, a 21-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I've dived into programming, and I'm excited to be here at the datathon! I've always enjoyed learning, especially when it comes to gaming and tech. When I'm not studying, you can find me trying out lifehacks or exploring ways to boost my productivity. I'm a people person and I love meeting new faces, which is why I'm looking forward to mingling with fellow enthusiasts and learning from them. For me, it's all about having a blast and immersing myself in the community. See you there!
