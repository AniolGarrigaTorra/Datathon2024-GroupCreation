Hey there! As for my objective, I'm all about leveling up my game! I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis and machine learning during this datathon. My main goal is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills, whether it's exploring new tools, learning from other participants, or working on projects that challenge me. I'm not competing to win or just hanging out to make friends (although that'll be awesome too!). I'm here to soak up knowledge, push myself outside my comfort zone, and become a better programmer and problem-solver. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Elena Rosselli, an 18-year-old student with a passion for data analysis and programming. I've been tinkering with code for a few years now, and I'm excited to level up my skills at this datathon. I'm all about exploration, learning, and self-improvement. Outside of class, you can find me dabbling in e-commerce or health-related projects, or brainstorming ways to use tech for social good. I'm a curious and creative problem-solver, and I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences and learning from others. Let's get data-crunching!
