I'm all about embracing the datathon vibes and making it a unforgettable experience! My objective is to mingle, learn, and have a blast with fellow attendees. I'm not obsessed with winning, and I'm not looking to improve my coding skills (although that's a bonus!). My focus is on soaking up the atmosphere, trying new foods, attending workshops, and meeting fellow coding enthusiasts. If I walk away with some awesome new friends and memories, that's the real prize for me! Hey there! I'm Sofia Ad√©laide Langley, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I'm a third-year student with a moderate background in programming. I'm really passionate about innovative technologies that can make a positive impact. I love attending workshops and meetups, where I can meet fellow coders and share ideas. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying out new food spots or exploring different parts of the city. I'm all about having a great time and making meaningful connections with others. Let's see where this datathon takes us!
