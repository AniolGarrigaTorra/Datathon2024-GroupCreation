Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to give it my all and compete to win. I'm all about challenging myself and pushing my limits. I'm excited to take on this opportunity to prove my skills and see how far I can go. I'm not looking to hold back or just have a good time (although that's important too, of course!). I'm here to hustle, problem-solve, and bring home that top prize. Bring it on, datathon! Hey, I'm Aur√®lia! I'm a 2nd-year student with a thirst for adventure and a competitive spirit. I'm all about embracing new challenges and pushing myself to the limit. I'm excited to take on the datathon and see what I'm capable of. When I'm not in class, you can find me indulging in web development, cyber security, and quantum weirdness. My friends would describe me as passionate, determined, and a bit of a perfectionist (don't worry, I won't tell them you knew that). I'm ready to unleash my inner datathon beast and give it my all - bring it on!
