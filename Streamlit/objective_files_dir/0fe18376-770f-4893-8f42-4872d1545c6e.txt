My objective for this datathon is to have a blast! I'm not really about the competitive aspect, I just want to learn new things, meet awesome people, and soak up the datathon vibe. I'd love to attend every single event, workshop, or meetup, and connect with fellow participants on a personal level. I'm hoping to leave with a ton of new skills, some awesome new friends, and a bunch of unforgettable memories. Let's make this a datathon to remember! Hey there! I'm Aurora Valentino, a 21-year-old university student with a passion for creating awesome digital experiences. I'm excited to be part of this datathon, hoping to learn new things, make awesome friends, and have a blast! When I'm not buried in textbooks, I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to streamline tasks and boost productivity. I believe that technology should make our lives easier and more enjoyable, and I'm eager to learn from and contribute to like-minded individuals. Let's get ready to kick off this incredible journey together!
