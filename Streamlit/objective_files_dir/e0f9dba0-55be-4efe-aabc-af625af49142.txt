For me, this datathon is all about leveling up my skills and knowledge. As a 3rd-year student with some hackathon experience, I've got a solid foundation, but I'm eager to dive deeper into new tools and techniques. I'm hoping to work on a project that pushes me out of my comfort zone and challenges me to think creatively. I'm excited to learn from other participants, mentors, and judges, and to take away some actionable tips to improve my coding skills and approach to problem-solving. Bring on the challenges! Hey there! I'm Ana√Øs, a 21-year-old third-year student with a passion for learning and pushing my coding skills to the limit. As a competitive programmer, I've always sought out new challenges and opportunities to grow. With a foundation in programming, I'm now looking to level up my expertise and apply it to real-world problems. I'm excited to dive into uncharted territory, think outside the box, and work on a project that takes me out of my comfort zone. This datathon is my chance to take my skills to the next level and network with like-minded individuals.
