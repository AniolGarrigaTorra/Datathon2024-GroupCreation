Hey there! I'm Sophie, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! My main goal is to meet new people, have an amazing time, and get involved in as many events as I can. I've participated in a couple of hackathons before, but this is going to be my first datathon and I'm stoked to see what it's all about. I'm looking forward to trying new things, laughing with fellow participants, and making some awesome memories. Let's crush this datathon and make it one to remember! Hey everyone, I'm Sophie! I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I'm a first-year student trying to make the most of my college experience. I've had a taste of coding before, and I'm really looking forward to diving deeper into it. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me bingeing true crime podcasts or daydreaming about robots that can make our lives easier. Can't wait to meet all of you and make some unforgettable memories together! Let's have some fun and crush this datathon!
