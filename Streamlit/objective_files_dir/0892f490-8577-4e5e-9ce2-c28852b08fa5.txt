Hey there! I'm Katja, and for this datathon, my top priority is to take home that top spot. I've been around the block a few times, having participated in three hackathons prior, but I'm always up for a challenge. My goal is to focus all my energy on delivering a project that stands out from the crowd. I'll be pushing myself to learn new tricks, think creatively, and work diligently with my teammates to bring our vision to life. Expect a fierce competitor, ready to give it my all to emerge victorious! Hey! I'm Katja, a 22-year-old coding enthusiast and 4th-year student. When I'm not poring over code, you can find me jamming out to music or experimenting with art. I'm all about tackling complex problems and making a real impact. I've had a taste of competition in hackathons past, and I'm ready to bring my A-game to this datathon. I'm a total optimist, believing that the right blend of creativity and determination can conquer anything. Get ready for a collaborative and fun adventure - and maybe, just maybe, I'll be standing on that top spot podium at the end!
