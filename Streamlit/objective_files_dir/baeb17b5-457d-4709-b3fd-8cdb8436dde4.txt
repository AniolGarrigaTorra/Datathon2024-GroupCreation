Hi! As Sofia, I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! My objective is simple: I want to learn as much as I can and level up my skills. I'm a PhD student, so I'm always looking for opportunities to develop my programming skills and explore new technologies. I'm excited to dive into new challenges and experiment with different approaches. My ultimate goal is to come out of this datathon with a fresh perspective, some cool new projects, and a sense of accomplishment. I'm all about growth and learning, so bring on the challenges!
