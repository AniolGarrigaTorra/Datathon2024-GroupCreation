My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to dive deep into the world of data and expand my skill set. As a programming enthusiast, I've participated in six hackathons so far, and I've loved the creative challenge. For this datathon, I'm focusing on building my expertise in a specific area - hopefully machine learning. I'm eager to learn new techniques, work with diverse datasets, and apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. By the end of the event, I aim to have grown as a developer and made meaningful connections with like-minded individuals. Let the learning begin! Hi there! I'm Montserrat García López, a 22-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving and learning. I've been programming for a while and have a strong background in data analysis. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I'm looking to dive deeper into machine learning and expand my skillset. Outside of code, I enjoy creating art and music, and I believe that's where my analytical mind comes into play. My goal is to build meaningful connections and bring new ideas to the table. I'm ready to get started and have fun along the way!
