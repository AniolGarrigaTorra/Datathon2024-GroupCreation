Hey! My objective for this datathon is to take my skills to the next level. As a 2nd-year student with some experience under my belt, I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis and machine learning. I'm looking forward to challenging myself, learning new tools and techniques, and experimenting with different approaches to solve real-world problems. My goal is to come out of this datathon with a solid understanding of complex concepts and new project ideas that I can incorporate into my studies or apply to future hackathons. Let's learn and grow together! Hi! I'm Alessia, a 19-year-old second-year student with a passion for devoting my free time to coding and exploring new technologies. I've dabbled in a range of languages, but my true fascination lies in the worlds of databases and blockchain. Outside of code, you can find me jamming out to music or lost in art exhibitions. For this datathon, I'm eager to level up my skills and take on new challenges. Bring on the innovative problem-solving and creative collaborations!
