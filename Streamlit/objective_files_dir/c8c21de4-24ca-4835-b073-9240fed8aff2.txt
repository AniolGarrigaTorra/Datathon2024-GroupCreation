I'm super excited to join this datathon with an objective to make the most of my experience. I'm not about getting too caught up in competing or solely focusing on improving my skills - although those things are definitely important, I prioritize having fun and making new friends over everything! I want to participate in as many events as I can, take in the atmosphere, and learn from the amazing people around me. I'm hoping to network, make some unforgettable memories, and even pick up a new trick or two along the way! Hey there! I'm Emily Wellesley, a third-year student with a passion for tech and a curious mind. I've dabbled in programming for a bit, and I'm excited to take on new challenges at this datathon. While I'm serious about learning and improving, I'm just as excited to meet fellow tech enthusiasts and have an amazing time. Expect me to be cheerful, always willing to lend a helping hand, and soaking up every bit of knowledge like a sponge! Let's make some unforgettable memories together!
