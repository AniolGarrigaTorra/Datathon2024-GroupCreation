My objective for this datathon is to soak up as much as I can and improve my skills. I've participated in five hackathons before, but this one feels like a chance to take my learning to the next level. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into new tools and techniques, and challenging myself to think outside the box. I'd love to work on projects that push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to problem-solve with a fresh perspective. By the end of the datathon, I want to feel more confident in my abilities and excited to apply what I've learned in real-world projects. Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a 21-year-old student eager to dive into the datathon and learn as much as I can. With three years of programming experience under my belt, I'm looking to level up my skills and push myself out of my comfort zone. I'm passionate about using tech to make a difference, whether it's in cybersecurity, fintech, or design. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over lifehacks and innovative solutions. I'm excited to meet new people and collaborate on projects that challenge me to think creatively. Bring it on!
