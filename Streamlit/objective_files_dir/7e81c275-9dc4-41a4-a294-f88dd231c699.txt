Hi! As a student, I'm looking to make the most out of this datathon by focusing on learning new skills and taking my programming abilities to the next level. I'm aiming to dive deep into the challenges, experiment with new technologies, and challenge myself to think creatively. My objective is to leave this event feeling like I've leveled up my skills and having a solid foundation to tackle even more complex projects. I'm excited to take on new concepts, receive feedback, and grow as a programmer. Wish me luck! Hi everyone! I'm Kaelin, a 21-year-old student with a passion for coding and making a positive impact. I've been exploring the world of programming for a while now, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. With a focus on cybersecurity, social good, and innovative tech, I'm looking forward to diving deep into challenges and experimenting with new technologies.
