I'm hoping to participate in every event, chat with fellow participants, and make some unforgettable memories. So, let's have a blast and see where this datathon takes us! Hey there! I'm Evelyn, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon! When I'm not buried under books and coding, you can find me gaming with friends or exploring the world of fintech.

For this datathon, I'm most excited to dive into new projects, meet fellow geeks, and learn from their experiences.
