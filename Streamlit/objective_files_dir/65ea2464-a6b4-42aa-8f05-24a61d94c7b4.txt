Hey, I'm Aurélie! For this datathon, my objective is to dive into the vibe and soak up the fun! I want to meet new people, learn about their projects, and share my own passion for coding. I'm super pumped to participate in as many events as I can, from workshops to hack challenges. My focus is on making new friends and having an awesome time, rather than competing to win. Bring on the caffeine and let's do this! Hi! I'm Aurélie, a 20-year-old student with a passion for coding. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, ready to dive into the world of data and innovation. I'm a bit of a newbie, but I'm eager to learn and make new connections. When I'm not geeking out over code, I enjoy exploring new music and art, and I'm super enthusiastic about how tech can make a positive impact on society. I'm all about collaboration and having a blast, so let's chat about your project and what brings you to the datathon!
