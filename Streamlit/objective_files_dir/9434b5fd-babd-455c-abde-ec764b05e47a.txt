As a 20-year-old programming student, I'm all about that competitive streak! My objective for this datathon is to compete and give it my all to win. I'm hungry for that top spot and I'm ready to put in the work. My experience in one hackathon has only fuelled my determination to take it to the next level. I'm planning to focus on developing an innovative solution that addresses a real-world problem, while also collaborating with fellow participants to create something truly exceptional. Wish me luck! Hey there! I'm Ant√≥nia Gaspard, a third-year student with a passion for coding and competition. I'm always up for a challenge and thrive in fast-paced environments. In my free time, you can find me jamming to music or creating art, but coding is my ultimate rush. I've gained some experience in hackathons and am ready to take my skills to the next level. I'm excited to collaborate with others and push my limits to create something amazing. My motto? Work hard, be bold, and never give up - that's the formula for success, and I'm ready to put it into practice!
