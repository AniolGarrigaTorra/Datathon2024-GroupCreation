Hey! As a student majoring in Computer Science, my main objective for this datathon is to push myself out of my comfort zone and learn as much as I can. I'm looking to improve my programming skills, expand my knowledge in data science, and discover new tools and techniques that can help me grow professionally. I'm excited to learn from my peers, get feedback, and maybe even stumble upon new opportunities. Ultimately, I want to come out of this datathon feeling empowered and confident in my abilities. Hey everyone, I'm Sof√≠a! I'm a 20-year-old computer science student trying to learn as much as I can about data science. I've been dabbling in programming for a bit, but I'm really eager to take on new challenges and level up my skills. Outside of coding, I'm super curious about how technology can impact everyday life, from making e-commerce more efficient to improving health monitoring systems. I'm stoked to be a part of this datathon and can't wait to learn from all of you!
