My goal is to complete each challenge quickly and efficiently, and I'm willing to put in the late nights and extra effort to make sure I do. I want to prove to myself that I've got what it takes to win, and I'm ready to leave it all on the line. Hey there! I'm Maria Elise Gast√≥n, a 17-year-old student with a fire in my belly.
