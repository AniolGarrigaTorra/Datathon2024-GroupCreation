I'm all about having a blast and meeting awesome people! My objective for this datathon is to immerse myself in the experience and soak up the atmosphere. I'm excited to attend workshops, participate in team-building activities, and explore the hackathon ecosystem. I want to make connections with fellow participants and mentors, and learn new skills along the way. My goal is to come out of this feeling like I've gained something more valuable than just coding knowledge - I want to leave with a new network of friends and unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Ariadna, a 19-year-old university student with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon, where I can meet fellow enthusiasts and learn from industry experts. With a background in programming and data analysis, I'm looking forward to diving into some new projects and having a blast with fellow participants. In my free time, you can find me jamming to some indie tunes or dabbling in digital art. I'm all about fostering a supportive community and making unforgettable memories. Let's make some noise together!
