For me, this datathon is about leveling up my skills and learning from others. I'm eager to dive deeper into programming and data analysis, and I believe this competition is the perfect opportunity to challenge myself. I'm setting a goal to master at least two new tools or techniques by the end of the datathon, and I'm excited to collaborate with others who share my passion for learning. I'm not looking to win just for the sake of winning, but rather to come out with new knowledge and skills that will help me become a better developer in the long run. Hi there!
