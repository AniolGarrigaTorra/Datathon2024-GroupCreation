Hey! I'm all about having an awesome time and meeting new people at this datathon. I'm not too worried about winning or getting all technical, I just want to have fun and be part of this awesome community. I want to soak up the vibe, attend as many events as I can, and chat with fellow datathoners about their projects. I'm hoping to learn something new, but more importantly, I want to make some rad new friends and memories to look back on. Let's get this datathon party started! Hey there! I'm Aurora, but my friends call me Rory. I'm a curious and artsy 18-year-old student in my first year of university. By day, I'm trying to figure out how to code, but by night, I'm probably jamming on my guitar or drawing something weird. I'm all about creativity and experimentation, and I'm super excited to be at the datathon! I'm here to soak up the vibes, learn some new things, and make some rad new friends. Let's have some fun!
