Hey there! My objective for this datathon is all about soaking up the atmosphere and having a blast! I'm looking forward to making some awesome new friends, learning from them, and sharing my own skills and experiences. I want to participate in as many events and activities as possible, and just generally have a great time. Of course, who knows, maybe I'll even discover some new programming gems along the way! But ultimately, I'm here to chill, be social, and enjoy the ride with some amazing fellow data enthusiasts! Hey there! I'm Gisella, a 24-year-old masters student with a passion for combining programming with creative pursuits. When I'm not diving into code, you can find me immersed in the world of gaming or experimenting with new life hacks. As a data enthusiast, I'm stoked to be joining this datathon and can't wait to geek out with like-minded individuals. My objective is all about having an amazing time, learning from others, and sharing my own experiences. I'm all about embracing the excitement and soaking up the atmosphere - see you around!
