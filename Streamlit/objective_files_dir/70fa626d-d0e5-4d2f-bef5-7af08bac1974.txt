My goal for this datathon is simple: I'm here to win. I've got some fresh programming skills and a passion to push myself to the limit. I'm looking to compete against others and come out on top. I've had a taste of what it takes to build something from scratch at my last hackathon, and I'm ready to take it to the next level. I want to prove to myself that I've got what it takes to be the best, and I'm willing to put in the hard work to make it happen. Hey there! I'm NÃºria Emerson, a 19-year-old student with a passion for creating something from nothing. I've had a taste of the rush of building a project from scratch at my last hackathon, and I'm hooked.
