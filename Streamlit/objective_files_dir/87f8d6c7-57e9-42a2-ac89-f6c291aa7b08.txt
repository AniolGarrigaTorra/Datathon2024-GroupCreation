My goal for this datathon is to make the most of the experience! I'm all about having a blast, learning new things alongside awesome people, and taking part in as many events as I can. I'm excited to meet fellow datathon enthusiasts, get creative with coding, and soak up the fun atmosphere. I'm not too hung up on winning - if I happen to crush a challenge or two along the way, that's just a nice bonus! For me, it's all about the friendships, the laughter, and the unforgettable memories. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Evie, a third-year student with a passion for all things tech. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon and can't wait to geek out with like-minded people. I've dabbled in a bit of programming, and I'm always looking to learn more. Outside of coding, you can find me experimenting with life hacks or dreaming up crazy robotics projects. For this datathon, I'm all about making friends, having fun, and maybe even crushing a challenge or two (but that's just a bonus). Let's do this!
