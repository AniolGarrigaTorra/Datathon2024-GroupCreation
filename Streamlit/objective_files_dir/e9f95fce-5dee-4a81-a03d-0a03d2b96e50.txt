I'm all about having a blast at this datathon! My goal is to make new friends and have fun while getting a taste of what it's like to work on real-world projects with others. I'm not too fussed about winning, as my three previous hackathons have taught me that the actual prize is meeting fellow coding enthusiasts and learning from their experiences. I'm excited to dive into the datathon's events, workshops, and activities, and soak up as much as I can. Bring on the fun and friendships! Hey, I'm Elodie! I'm a third-year student and a coding enthusiast with a passion for working on exciting projects. I've had my fair share of hackathons and love the energy and camaraderie that comes with it. This time, I'm not too focused on the outcome, but on making the most of this experience and connecting with like-minded folks. Outside of coding, I'm all about staying curious and exploring the latest trends and technologies. Bring on the fun and learning - let's make some unforgettable memories!
