My objective for this datathon is all about embracing the social side of things! I want to have an amazing time, meet fellow datathon enthusiasts, and soak up as many experiences as possible. I'm looking forward to participating in workshops, trying out new technologies, and of course, jamming with other coders. My main goal is to make new friends and create unforgettable memories. Let's get this datathon party started! I'm stoked to be here and see where the adventure takes me! Hey there! I'm Amanda, a curious and adventurous second-year student excited to dive into this datathon. I'm all about trying new things, whether it's exploring emerging tech or geeking out over data. My passion is making the most of the social experience - meeting fellow coding enthusiasts, sharing stories, and creating unforgettable memories. When I'm not geeking out, you can find me daydreaming about robotics or blockchain innovations. Can't wait to jam with others, soak up new skills, and take away an amazing experience from this datathon!
