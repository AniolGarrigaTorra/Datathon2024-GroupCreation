You know me, I'm all about having a good time and meeting new people! For this datathon, my objective is simple: I want to make as many new friends as I can, and have an absolute blast while doing it. I don't care if I come in first or last, as long as I get to learn new things and enjoy the company of fellow datathon enthusiasts. I'll be taking part in as many events as possible, and just soaking up all the experience and networking opportunities I can get. Let's make this datathon one to remember! Hey everyone! I'm SÃ²nia Rose Ellis, a 21-year-old student with a passion for tech and socializing. I've been playing around with code for a few years now, and I'm excited to level up my skills and meet like-minded individuals at this datathon. I'm all about learning new things, making new friends, and having a great time. You can find me attending most of the events, trying new things, and swapping war stories with fellow coders. Let's have some fun and make this datathon an unforgettable experience!
