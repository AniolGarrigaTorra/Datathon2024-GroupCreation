For me, it's all about the experience and making connections. I'm here to meet fellow coding enthusiasts, learn from their perspectives, and grow as a person. I'm not too bothered about winning; I'd rather focus on having a blast, attending all the workshops, and being part of the datathon vibe! My goal is to come out of this event with new friendships, unforgettable memories, and a renewed sense of excitement for the world of data. Let's get this party started! Hey there! I'm Pilar, a 2nd-year student trying to make the most out of my college experience. As a wannabe techie, I'm all about diving into new projects and learning from my mistakes. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to meet fellow coding enthusiasts who share my passions. For me, it's about the journey, not the destination - I want to soak up new ideas, make unforgettable memories, and come out of this with a spark to explore more in the world of data and tech. Can't wait to get started!
