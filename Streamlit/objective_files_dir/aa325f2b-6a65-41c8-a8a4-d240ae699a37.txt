My objective for this datathon is to have an amazing time with fellow participants! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, learning from their experiences, and sharing my own knowledge too. I don't plan to compete or worry about winning - my goal is simply to soak up the atmosphere and participate in as many events as I can. I want to laugh, socialize, and maybe even discover some new hobbies or passions. It's all about having fun and making lifelong connections with fellow datathon enthusiasts! Hey there! I'm Ana Lisa, a curious and creative 21-year-old student with a passion for tech. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming to music, lost in art, or tinkering with code. I've dabbled in DevOps and Voice skills, and I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of IoT and AR/VR. For me, this datathon is all about immersing myself in an exciting atmosphere, learning from like-minded individuals, and discovering new passions. I'm ready to let my hair down, be a sponge, and make some unforgettable memories with fellow enthusiasts!
