For me, this datathon is all about growing as a programmer. I've had some experience, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm aiming to push my skills to the next level by tackling new challenges and technologies. I'm open to feedback and willing to take risks, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone. My goal is to come away from this event with a new set of skills and knowledge, and a fresh perspective on how to approach problem-solving. Let's see what this weekend brings! Hey there! I'm Llu√≠s, a 21-year-old student on a mission to improve my programming chops. I've got some experience under my belt, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm all about pushing myself to the next level and tackling new challenges. I'm curious about the latest tech trends and love diving into different areas, from gaming to education. This datathon is all about taking a leap out of my comfort zone and coming back with new skills and perspectives. Bring on the coding adventure!
