My main objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into the world of data analysis and improve my skills. I'm excited to tackle challenging projects, learn new tools and techniques, and absorb as much knowledge as I can. I'm not looking to compete or win; I just want to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer. I'm hoping to come out of this event with a stronger foundation in data analysis and a fresh perspective on the field. Bring on the data! Hey, I'm Aurora! I'm a 2nd-year student with a passion for solving problems and creating cool stuff. I've always been intrigued by how data can help us understand and improve things. For this datathon, I'm looking to level up my data analysis skills and explore the possibilities of combining technology with social good. When I'm not coding, you can find me humming to my favorite tunes or sketching out some art inspiration. I'm excited to learn from others, get out of my comfort zone, and have a blast during this datathon adventure!
