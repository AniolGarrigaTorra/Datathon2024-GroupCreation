My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win. I've got my sights set on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the hard work to get there. As a beginner programmer, I know I've got something to prove to myself and others. I'm looking to learn some new tricks and tools along the way, but my focus is on crushing the competition. I'm ready to put in the long hours, push myself outside of my comfort zone, and see where it takes me. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Lukas Weber, a 19-year-old university student determined to dominate this datathon. I'm a newbie to the coding scene, but I'm ready to put in the work to take down the competition. My passion for design and e-commerce drives me to create innovative solutions, and I'm stoked to learn new skills and tricks along the way. When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with mobile apps or discovering new lifehacks. I'm here to prove myself and bring home that top prize - let's get this started!
