My objective for this datathon is to have a blast and make new connections! As a introvert, hackathons can be overwhelming, but I'm excited to break out of my comfort zone and participate in as many events as possible. I'm all about learning, but my main goal is to have fun and meet like-minded people. I'd love to attend workshops, join discussions, and collaborate on projects that spark my interest. My ultimate goal is to leave this datathon with a fresh perspective, new skills, and a handful of awesome new friends. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, a 20-year-old third-year student, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. As an introvert, I'm not always the first to jump into a conversation, but once I get going, I love making new connections and learning from others. I'm all about breaking out of my comfort zone and trying new things, whether it's a coding challenge or a discussion on a new topic. For me, it's all about having fun, meeting like-minded people, and walking away with a fresh perspective and new skills. I'm looking forward to sharing this experience with all of you!
