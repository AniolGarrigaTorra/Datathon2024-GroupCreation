My objective for this datathon is all about having a blast and making connections! I'm hoping to learn some new tricks and gain experience, but primarily, I just want to soak up the atmosphere and vibe with other participants. I'm excited to try new things, attend seminars and workshops, and take part in as many activities as possible. Ultimately, I'm looking forward to walking away with some new friends and memories to cherish - and who knows, maybe a few coding tricks up my sleeve! Hey there! I'm Alejandra English, a 20-year-old student looking to shake things up at this datathon. With a passion for using tech for social good and a knack for experimenting with new ideas, I'm all about learning and having fun. Whether it's hacking on a Lifehack or building something that changes the world, I'm ready to soak up the energy and vibe with fellow participants. When I'm not coding, you can find me tapping away on my guitar or browsing through art books. Bring on the datathon adventures - let's make some memories!
