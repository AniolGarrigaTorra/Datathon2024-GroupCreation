My objective for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and have an absolute blast! I'm not a hardcore coding wizard, but I love the vibes and energy of these events. I'd rather focus on meeting fellow participants, learning from them, and sharing my own experiences. I want to soak up all the fun events, workshops, and activities on offer, and maybe even squeeze in some cool projects on the side. My goal is to create lasting connections, learn new skills, and go home feeling inspired and energized. Can't wait to get started! Hey there! I'm SÃ²nia Engel Finch, a 21-year-old student enthusiast. I'm pumped to be here at the datathon! I'm a newbie in the coding world, but I'm eager to learn and make connections. I'm excited to explore the innovative vibes, workshops, and events on offer. My goal is to soak up as much fun and knowledge as possible, while making some amazing friends along the way. I'm all about staying curious, being inspired, and sharing experiences.
