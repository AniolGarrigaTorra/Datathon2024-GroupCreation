My main goal for this datathon is to crush it and take home that first prize! With my 5 hackathon experiences under my belt, I'm confident in my ability to deliver a solid solution. I'm looking forward to throwing myself into the challenge, grinding hard, and seeing how close I can get to perfection. My sights are set on the top spot, and I'm willing to put in the extra effort to make it happen. I'm ready to work with like-minded competitors, absorb feedback, and push myself to the limit to come out on top. Hey there! I'm Amandine, a 20-year-old student with a passion for coding and design. I've had five hackathon experiences under my belt, and I'm looking to take my skills to the next level. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me experimenting with new lifehacks or keeping up with the latest fintech trends. I'm a creative problem-solver with a drive to succeed, and I'm excited to put my skills to the test in this datathon. Let's make some magic happen!
