I'm excited to participate in as many events as possible, from workshops to hackathons, and learn from the expertise of the organizing team. My goal is to soak up knowledge, create connections, and build memories that'll last a lifetime. Can't wait to meet you and rock this datathon! Hi there! I'm Emily, a 22-year-old undergraduate student who's passionate about making a meaningful impact through technology. I've dabbled in various programming languages and technologies, but Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have really sparked my interest. I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in productivity and mobile app development. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me gaming or exploring the outdoors. For this datathon, I'm excited to meet fellow tech enthusiasts, learn from industry experts, and have a blast doing so!
