I'm all about vibing with my fellow datathon enthusiasts! My objective is to make the most of this amazing experience by having an absolute blast with new friends. I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, whether it's a data challenge, a workshop, or just a casual meetup. I'm not too fussed about winning, I'd rather be having fun and learning from everyone's unique perspectives. By the end of the datathon, I hope to have formed some lifelong connections and memories that'll keep me buzzing long after the competition ends. Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 20-year-old student on a mission to geek out and connect with fellow datathon enthusiasts. I'm super passionate about blending technology with human touch to create meaningful experiences. In my free time, I love experimenting with innovative projects that merge IoT, machine learning, and AI. I'm a chatty and adventurous soul who believes learning is just as valuable as winning, so I'm all about embracing new experiences and making lifelong connections. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon journey and can't wait to vibe with you!
