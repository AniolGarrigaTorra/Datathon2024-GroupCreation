As someone who's been hooked on coding since I was 15, I'm all about the competitive spirit! My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to crush it and come out on top. I want to push myself to the limit, learn new tricks, and exploit every bug I can find. My goal is to build the best project I can, and if that means sacrificing sleep and socializing for the sake of code-crunching, then so be it! Bring it on, datathon! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 20-year-old coding enthusiast with a passion for pushing boundaries. I've been hooked on programming since I was 15 and I'm now in my second year of studies. I'm here to compete, learn, and unleash my inner coding beast. I love the thrill of the chase, the rush of finding that one elusive bug, and the satisfaction of seeing my project come to life. My motto? Sleep is optional, coding is my passion. Let's crush this datathon!
