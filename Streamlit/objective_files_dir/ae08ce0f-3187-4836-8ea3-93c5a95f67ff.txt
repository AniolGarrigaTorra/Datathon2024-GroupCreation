Hey! I'm Ana Lucia, and I'm gearing up for this datathon with a winning mentality. My objective is clear: I'm all about bringing that trophy home! I've participated in three hackathons, and I'm confident in my skills, but I'm aware that datathons require a different level of competition. I plan to give it my all, dedicating as much time as needed to research, brainstorm, and develop the best solution possible. I'm ready to face the challenge head-on and leave it all on the table. Game on! Hey there! I'm Ana Lucia, and I'm pumped to be participating in this datathon. As a 22-year-old student, I'm always looking for innovative ways to combine my passions for problem-solving and tech. With a background in programming and experience in hackathons, I'm confident in my ability to think on my feet and come up with creative solutions. My goal is to bring home the trophy and show the world what I'm capable of. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over Lifehacks or trying out new Fintech apps. Let's get this started!
