Hey there! So, for me, it's all about having a blast and making the most of this amazing experience! I'm super stoked to meet fellow data enthusiasts and make some new friends. I'm more interested in exploring new skills and exploring events outside of the actual coding - like hackathons and meetups. My goal is to participate in as many activities as possible, like workshop sessions, networking sessions, and even those quirky team-building challenges (yes, I'm all about the games!). I just want to be part of this crazy cool datathon vibe and soak it all in! Hey everyone! I'm Lilou Rivi√®re, a 18-year-old student thrilled to be here at the datathon! When I'm not in class, you can find me tinkering with code or binge-playing my favorite video games. I've got a passion for using technology to make a difference, especially in the world of health and wellness. I'm all about learning new skills and trying new things, and this event seems like the perfect place to do just that. I'm stoked to meet other data enthusiasts and make some unforgettable memories - let's do this!
