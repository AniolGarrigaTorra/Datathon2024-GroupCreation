My objective for this datathon is to bring home the win! I've been to three hackathons before, and I'm itching for that first-place trophy. I'm an 18-year-old student with intermediate programming skills, but I'm determined to show off my skills and prove to myself that I can really take on the challenge. I'm not interested in just having fun (although, let's be real, some fun would be awesome too), I'm in it to win it. I'll be fully focused on crushing the competition and taking home that top spot! Hey there! I'm Marie Camille, a driven 18-year-old student looking to crush it at this datathon. With a background in programming and a passion for building innovative solutions, I'm ready to unleash my creativity and skill-set to bring home the win. When I'm not coding, you can catch me jamming to indie tunes or designing in my free time. I thrive under pressure and am always up for a challenge. So, buckle up and get ready for a fierce competitor - I'm excited to be a part of this datathon and can't wait to see what magic we can create together!
