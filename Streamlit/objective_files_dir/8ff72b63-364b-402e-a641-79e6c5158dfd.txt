My goal for this datathon is straightforward: I'm all about that winning feeling! I'm a competitive spirit at heart, and I've got a strong desire to take home that top prize. I've been in three hackathons before, and I know how intense the competition can get. I've honed my skills, and I'm ready to put everything I've learned to the test. Bring on the challenges, and I'll be gunning for that number one spot. Winning isn't everything, but it's definitely a big part of my motivation to push myself to be my best and crush the competition! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a curious and competitive 18-year-old student always looking for the next big challenge. I've been geeking out over tech and innovation since high school, and I've managed to participate in three hackathons already. My sweet spot is bridging the gap between education and technology, and I'm fascinated by the possibilities of machine learning and AR/VR. When I'm not coding or gaming, you can find me experimenting with lifehacks and finding ways to make life more efficient. I'm all about having fun and pushing myself to be my best, and I'm excited to bring my skills to this datathon!
