For me, this datathon is all about growth and self-improvement. As a beginner programmer, I'm still learning the ropes and I want to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to level up my skills. My objective is to dive deep into the project, challenge myself, and learn as many new things as possible. I'm excited to see what techniques and technologies I can explore and how I can apply them to real-world problems. Most importantly, I want to emerge from this event with a sense of accomplishment and a solid foundation to build upon. Hey there! I'm Giovanna Sabatini, a 19-year-old student on a mission to level up my programming skills. I'm currently in my first year of studies, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon. My passion lies in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of Machine Learning and AI. As a beginner programmer, I'm looking forward to learning new techniques and technologies, and applying them to real-world problems. For me, this datathon is all about growth, self-improvement, and having fun while doing it!
