My objective for this datathon is to win. I've had some hackathon experience and I'm confident in my programming skills, but I know the competition will be tough. I want to bring home that first-place prize and prove to myself that I'm capable of it. I'm all about the thrill of the competition and the rush of adrenaline when the clock is ticking. I'll give it my all, pouring all my focus into developing the best solution and crushing the challenges that come our way. Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 20-year-old student with a passion for programming and innovation. I'm currently in my second year of studies, with a intermediate level of experience in coding. I thrive in competitive environments, which is why I'm excited to take on this datathon challenge. My interests lie in building intelligent systems, solving real-world problems, and creating innovative products. I'm always looking for new opportunities to push my skills and take my ideas to the next level. Let's see what we can accomplish together in this datathon adventure!
