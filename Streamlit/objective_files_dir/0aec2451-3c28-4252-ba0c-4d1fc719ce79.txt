For this datathon, my goal is to dive deep into the world of data and come out stronger and more confident in my skills. I'm not necessarily looking to win a prize, but rather to expand my knowledge and take home some new tools and techniques. I'm excited to learn from the experts and tap into the collective experience of the other participants. I hope to leave this event with a newfound sense of competence and a fresh perspective on the exciting world of data analysis and visualization. Hey there! I'm Alessia Riley, a 21-year-old student diving into the world of data for the first time. With a background in computer science, I've been fascinated by the possibilities of technology and innovation. As a curious learner, I'm excited to explore the endless applications of data analysis and visualization. I'm hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and take away some practical skills to stay ahead of the curve. Above all, I'm looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts and mentors who share my passion for unlocking the secrets of data.
