My objective is clear: I'm here to crush it and bring home the win! As a hackathon novice with only one competition under my belt, I'm chomping at the bit to show off my skills and outdo the competition. I'll be pouring over the challenge criteria, strategizing with teammates, and grinding away at the code 24/7 to ensure that our project stands out from the rest. I'm not here to make friends (although that'd be awesome too), I'm here to win - so you can bet I'll be giving it my all! Hey there! I'm Alexandra Ruby Winston, a 19-year-old second-year student with a hunger for competition and a passion for creative problem-solving. When I'm not studying, you can find me expressing my artistic side through music or art. As a programming enthusiast with a background in tech, I'm confident in my intermediate-level skills. I've taken on a challenge to refine my coding abilities at this datathon. My goal? Winning, of course! Don't get me wrong, collaboration is crucial, but ultimately, I'm in this to take the crown. Wish me luck - or a strong code, haha!
