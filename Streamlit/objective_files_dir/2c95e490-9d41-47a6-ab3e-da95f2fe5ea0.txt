My goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and learn as much as I can. As a second-year student with only a beginner's grasp of programming, I'm eager to dive deeper into data analysis and exploration. I'm not here to win the competition, per se, but to challenge myself and develop my expertise. I'm excited to be part of a community of like-minded individuals and to learn from their experiences and perspectives. I hope to take away new knowledge, skills, and confidence that will help me excel in my degree and future career. Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 19-year-old second-year student with a passion for making a positive impact. When I'm not hiting the books, I love tinkering with coding and exploring the vast world of technology. I'm particularly excited about combining my love for art and design with the power of programming. This datathon represents a unique opportunity for me to level up my skills, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and learn from others. I'm a curious learner and am looking forward to diving deeper into data analysis and exploring the possibilities that come with it.
