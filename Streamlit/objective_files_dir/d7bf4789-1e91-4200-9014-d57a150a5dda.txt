My goal for this datathon is to soak up the experience and have a blast! I'm all about making new friends and having fun with like-minded people. I'd love to attend as many events as possible, whether it's a workshop, a keynote, or even just a chill session with fellow participants. I'm not super competitive and I don't care about winning; I just want to geek out over data, snacks, and awesome company. I'm excited to be part of this community and can't wait to see what this datathon has in store! Hi there! I'm María Sofía García, a 23-year-old student pursuing my Masters. I'm a curious and laid-back individual with a passion for all things data and tech. When I'm not stuck in a world of code, you can find me discovering new lifehacks or experimenting with AR/VR projects. I'm super excited to join this datathon community and indulge in the world of data, surrounded by like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm. I'm looking forward to making new friends, attending fun events, and learning new tricks. Let's have an amazing time together!
