Hey! So, I'm all about making the most of this datathon. My goal is to have a blast with the crew, learn new things, and attend every event possible. I'm not super competitive, so winning isn't my main objective. Instead, I want to soak up knowledge, try out new tools, and jam with other awesome folks. If we can even just have some serious laughter and good vibes, I'll consider it a win. Let's make some unforgettable memories and create something amazing together! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, a 21-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems using technology. I'm all about collaboration and creative thinking, which is why I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon. When I'm not studying, you can find me geeking out over voice skills, enterprise solutions, and cybersecurity. My approach is all about having fun, learning from others, and pushing myself to try new things. I'm looking forward to meeting you and making some unforgettable memories!
