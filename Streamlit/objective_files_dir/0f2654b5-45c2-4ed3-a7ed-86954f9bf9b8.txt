Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to really learn and level up my skills. I'm a student and I want to take advantage of this opportunity to gain more experience and get familiar with new tools and techniques. I'm not too worried about winning or placing high, as long as I can come out with some valuable takeaways and insight. My goal is to stay humble, work hard, and get the most out of this experience. I'm excited to learn from the others, and I hope I can also help my team grow and evolve together! Hi there! I'm Giovanna, a fourth-year student with a passion for tech. I've been dabbling in programming for a while now, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, I love exploring the world of Machine Learning, AR, and IoT. I'm all about learning, growth, and collaboration, so I'm stoked to be surrounded by like-minded individuals. For this datathon, I'm looking to up my game, take on new challenges, and make the most of this experience. Can't wait to see what the next 24 hours bring!
