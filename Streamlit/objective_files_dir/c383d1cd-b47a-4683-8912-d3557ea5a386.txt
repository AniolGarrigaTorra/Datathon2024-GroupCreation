For this datathon, my objective is to have a blast with fellow participants and make some new friends in the process! I'm not really competition-driven, and my goal isn't to win at all costs. Instead, I want to soak up the lively atmosphere, attend as many workshops and talks as I can, and join forces with others on fun projects. I'm looking forward to learning from each other, sharing tips and tricks, and making memories that go beyond just coding. Bring on the Datathon vibes! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a third-year student with a passion for learning and exploring new ideas. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkering with code, playing with AR/VR, or experimenting with innovative lifehacks. I'm all about making the most of every experience and finding ways to stay curious and creative. I'm really looking forward to this datathon - I've always loved collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts and learning from one another. Let's make some unforgettable memories, swap tips, and see what kind of magic we can create together!
