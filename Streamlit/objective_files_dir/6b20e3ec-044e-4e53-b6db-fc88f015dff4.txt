Hey there! As a second-year student, I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to make some amazing memories, meet fellow enthusiasts, and have a blast while doing so. I want to dive into the workshops, mingle with fellow participants, and soak up as much fun as I can! Winning isn't necessarily on my mind, as long as I take away something new and leave with friendships that will last beyond this datathon. Let's make some unforgettable moments together! Hey everyone! I'm Camila, an 18-year-old student from the second year. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon! When I'm not studying, I love being a communicator - whether it's through voice or in writing, I thrive on connecting with people. This datathon is an amazing opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, learn something new, and make lasting friendships. My goal is to take away some amazing memories and skills from this experience, and who knows, maybe I'll even discover a new passion!
