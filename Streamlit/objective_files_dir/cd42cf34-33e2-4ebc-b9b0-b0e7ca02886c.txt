Hey! My objective for this datathon is to have an awesome time, connect with other cool people, and try out as many new things as possible. I'm really looking forward to meeting fellow datathon enthusiasts and learning from their experiences. I'm not super competitive, so I won't be stressed about winning - I just want to soak up as much knowledge and fun as I can. Bring on the coding challenges, workshops, and social events - I'm ready to rock this datathon and create some unforgettable memories! Hi! I'm Anna Mariana Schneider, a 21-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. In my fourth year of studies, I've developed a solid foundation in programming and am always looking to try new things. Outside of class, you can find me exploring the world of augmented reality and voice skills, or geeking out over the latest gaming releases. When I'm not coding or gaming, you can bet I'm all about connection - be that through social media, online communities, or in-person events. I'm all about living life to the fullest, and this datathon is just the place to do that!
