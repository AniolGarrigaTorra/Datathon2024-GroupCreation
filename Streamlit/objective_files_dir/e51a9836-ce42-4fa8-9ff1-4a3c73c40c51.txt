My objective for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge and experience as possible. With only one hackathon under my belt, I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of data analysis and visualization. I want to learn new tools, techniques, and best practices to enhance my programming skills and stay ahead of the curve in my second year of uni. I'm open to feedback and guidance from mentors, and I'm looking forward to being part of a dynamic team that's passionate about learning and creating something amazing. Hey there! I'm Rebecca, a 20-year-old student looking forward to this datathon. As a second-year student, I'm eager to broaden my horizons in data analysis and visualization. With a passion for coding and solving real-world problems, I've already dabbled in various programming languages and frameworks. My ideal team consists of like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for learning and creating innovative solutions.
