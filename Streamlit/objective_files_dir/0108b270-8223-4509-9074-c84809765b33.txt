My goal for this datathon is to dive headfirst into new technologies and tools to further develop my programming skills. I'm looking forward to working on challenging projects that push me out of my comfort zone and help me learn from others. I'd love to absorb as much knowledge as possible from the mentors and fellow participants, and leave with a solid understanding of topics that will help me grow as a programmer. I'm not worried about winning or competing; I just want to take away new skills and experiences that will make me a better developer. Hey there! I'm Ana Maria Flynn, a 20-year-old student eager to dive into the datathon experience. As a programming newbie with a passion for innovation, I'm excited to challenge myself with new technologies and projects. I've had a taste of iOS development and Flutter, and I'm curious to learn more about AI and machine learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring design and productivity tools. My ultimate goal is to come away from this datathon with a sense of accomplishment and a fresh perspective on my programming skills.
