I'm Anaïs and my goal for this datathon is to level up my skills in data analysis and machine learning. I've already dipped my toes into coding through my degree and past hackathons, but I want to take it to the next level. I'm eager to learn from the other participants and experts, and apply my newfound knowledge to real-world problems. I'm hoping to walk away with a fresh perspective, new tools in my belt, and a sense of accomplishment that I've grown as a programmer. Bring on the data challenge! Hey there! I'm Anaïs, a 20-year-old student with a passion for using tech to make a positive impact. I've been fascinated by the intersection of data and real-world problems, and I'm excited to level up my skills in data analysis and machine learning at this datathon. With a background in programming through my studies, I'm looking to take my skills to the next level and apply them to tackling pressing issues. I'm eager to learn from others, exchange ideas, and emerge from this experience with new insights and a sense of accomplishment.
