I'm excited to participate in this datathon with a focus on expanding my skillset and learning as much as I can. My goal is to take on new challenges and master techniques I've always been curious about. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone and explore new areas of programming, whether it's machine learning, data visualization, or something entirely different. I'm looking forward to absorbing knowledge from other participants and mentors, and I hope to leave this event with a fresh perspective and a new set of skills to incorporate into my future projects. Hi there! I'm Ariana, a 21-year-old student with a passion for making an impact through tech. With a background in programming, I'm always excited to dive into new projects and take on challenges. I'm a bit of a nerd, and I love exploring the intersection of technology and social good. I'm looking forward to learning, growing, and pushing my boundaries at this datathon. I'm all about embracing the unknown and seeing where new skills and perspectives can take me. It's gonna be an awesome ride, and I'm stoked to be here!
