My objective for this datathon is to come out on top and win. I'm a competitive person by nature, and the rush of adrenaline and sense of accomplishment that comes with victory is what drives me. I've participated in five hackathons already and have gained valuable experience, but I'm determined to take it to the next level and stand out among the best. I'll put in the long hours, focus on solving the challenges quickly and efficiently, and do whatever it takes to emerge victorious. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Ava Foster, a 20-year-old undergraduate with a passion for problem-solving and a competitive streak a mile wide. I've got a knack for breaking things down into manageable pieces and figuring out innovative solutions. I'm all about efficiency, so I'm always looking for ways to shave off seconds or even milliseconds from my processes. When I'm not buried in books or coding away, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or learning a new language. I'm ready to put my skills to the test and take on this datathon - game on!
