I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! My objective is all about making the most of this experience and having a blast with new people! I want to make genuine connections with fellow participants, learn from their expertise, and share my own enthusiasm for data science. I'm not necessarily after the top spot, but rather I'm looking forward to participating in as many events and workshops as I can, and soaking up the vibes. I'm all about having fun, being sociable, and taking in the electric atmosphere. Bring on the datathon camaraderie! Hey there! I'm Alexandra Lane, an 18-year-old student and tech enthusiast. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon and excited to meet fellow passionate individuals like myself. I'm all about innovation, creativity, and learning, with a strong interest in pushing boundaries and exploring the latest trends in tech. When I'm not studying, you can find me dabbling in AR/VR, designing something new on Figma, or working on a side project. I'm here to soak up knowledge, make connections, and have a blast with like-minded people.
