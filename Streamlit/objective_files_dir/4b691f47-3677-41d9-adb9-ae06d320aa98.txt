I'm looking forward to leveling up my skills at this datathon! My goal is to dive deeper into machine learning and data visualization, and come out of here with a solid understanding of how to apply these concepts to real-world problems. I'm excited to learn from industry experts, get feedback on my work, and maybe even discover new tools or techniques to add to my toolkit. I'm not too concerned with winning; it's all about taking in as much as I can and growing as a developer. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, a second-year student with a passion for technology and innovation. I've dabbled in programming and am always eager to level up my skills. My interests span across the likes of machine learning, data visualization, and cybersecurity, with a knack for finding creative ways to tackle real-world problems. I'm excited to be part of this datathon, where I hope to immerse myself in industry insights, get feedback on my work, and take away valuable knowledge to apply to my own projects.
