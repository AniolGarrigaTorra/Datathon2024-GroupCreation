Hey! My objective for this datathon is to really challenge myself and push my coding skills to the next level. I'm still a beginner, so I'm hoping to learn new techniques, get exposure to different tools and technologies, and maybe even take away some real-world projects to improve my portfolio. I'm not really competitive, to be honest - I'd much rather be struggling with a tough problem and figuring it out than worrying about winning a prize. For me, it's all about growth and becoming a better developer by the end of it. Hey there! I'm Astrid, a 20-year-old student who's passionate about making a social impact through technology. As a beginner in programming, I'm all about learning and growth. I've had a fascination with the way code can shape real-world solutions, and I'm excited to challenge myself at this datathon. While I may not be a seasoned pro, I'm eager to soak up new techniques, collaborate with others, and maybe even take away a few practical projects to add to my portfolio. Let's see what this datathon has in store for me!
