My objective for this datathon is all about the vibes! I'm not here to stress about winning, and I'm not trying to level up my coding skills (at least, not too much, haha!). I'm looking forward to making new friends, having a blast, and participating in as many events as I can. I want to soak up the datathon atmosphere, try new things, and walk away with some amazing memories. I'm all about having fun and learning from the experience, so bring on the datathon shenanigans! Hey there! I'm Sofia Rose, a 19-year-old student taking a break from my studies to get weird and wonderful with datathon vibes! I'm not one for all-out competition, but I adore learning and making new friends. I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere, trying new things, and collecting memories. Think of me as the let's get cozy and hack together type!
