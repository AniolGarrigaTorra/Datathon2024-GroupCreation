My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm here to have a blast! I'm a first-year student and a total newbie to the programming world, so I'm not expecting to take home the trophy (although that would be amazing, LOL). Instead, I'm excited to meet new people, learn about cool data science projects, and participate in as many events as I can fit into my schedule. I want to soak up the atmosphere, make some new friends, and have an unforgettable experience. Bring on the fun! Hi there! I'm Sophie Esperanza, a 1st-year student with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm new to the programming world, but I'm eager to learn and have a blast while doing it. I'm all about finding creative solutions to real-world problems and using tech to make a positive impact. Whether it's mobile app development, data analysis, or DevOps, I'm up for a challenge. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow data enthusiasts and geeking out over the latest trends. When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming or trying out new cafes in town.
