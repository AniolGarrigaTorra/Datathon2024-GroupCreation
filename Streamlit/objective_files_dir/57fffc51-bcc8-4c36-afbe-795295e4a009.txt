My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win. As a second-timer, I've learned the importance of getting to work quickly and efficiently, and I'm confident that my Intermediate-level programming skills will give me an edge. I'm not looking to make friends or party - although I'm sure that will be a bonus! - but instead, I'm laser-focused on crushing the competition. Bring on the challenges and hackathons, I'm ready to put my skills to the test and take home the top prize. Hey, I'm Alejandro Vicens Rodr√≠guez, and I'm all about delivering results. I've been programming since I was a teen and have since honed my skills in Git, Natural Language Processing, and Data Analysis. With a passion for creating innovative solutions, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges. As a 20-year-old student, I'm confident in my ability to approach problems from different angles. With a healthy dose of competitiveness, I'm here to win this datathon and prove myself as a force to be reckoned with. Let's get down to business!
