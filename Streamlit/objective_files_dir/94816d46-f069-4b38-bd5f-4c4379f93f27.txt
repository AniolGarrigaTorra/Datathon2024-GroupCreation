Hey there! As Heidi von MÃ¼ller, my objective for this datathon is to hang out with awesome people, have a blast, and take part in as many events as I can. I'm super excited to meet fellow data enthusiasts and learn from their experiences. I'm not too fussed about winning - I just want to soak up the datathon vibes, attend some sick workshops, and make new buddies. I'm looking forward to exchanging funny memes, trying out new snacks, and generally having the time of my life. Let's make some memories, datathon fam! Hey there! I'm Heidi, a 21-year-old student with a passion for using tech for social good. I've been getting my hands dirty with programming for a few years now, and I'm loving the journey. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me looking for the most efficient way to do things or exploring new e-commerce tools. I'm all about productivity and making a difference. I'm stoked to be here for the datathon, excited to meet fellow enthusiasts, and looking forward to an unforgettable experience!
