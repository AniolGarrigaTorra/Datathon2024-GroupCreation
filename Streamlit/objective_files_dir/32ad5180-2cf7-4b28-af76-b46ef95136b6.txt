My objective for this datathon is to soak up the fun and learning vibes while making new connections! I'm all about meeting fellow coding enthusiasts and making some awesome friends. I'm looking forward to diving into various workshops, panels, and networking sessions. If I happen to create something cool along the way, that's just a bonus! My main goal is to leave this event with a big smile on my face, new knowledge in my head, and a collection of awesome memories with fellow participants. Time to get this datathon party started! Hi! I'm Sara Mas, a 20-year-old student eager to immerse myself in the datathon's dynamic atmosphere. As a computer science enthusiast, I'm always looking forward to collaborating with fellow coding geeks and creating something remarkable. My passion lies in using technology to drive positive change, especially in education and healthcare. In my free time, I love experimenting with new tools and technologies to spark creative ideas. I'm thrilled to be a part of this datathon, and I'm ready to soak up the knowledge, make unforgettable memories, and maybe even stumble upon a innovative idea or two!
