My objective for this datathon is simple - I want to have a blast! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, making friends, and soaking up all the fun events and activities. I'm excited to share ideas, learn from others, and collaborate on projects. I'll definitely keep my skills sharp, but I won't be too hard on myself about winning. My top priority is to make memories, laugh, and enjoy the experience. Let's make this datathon an unforgettable one! Hey there! I'm Lena Maria Weber, a college student with a passion for creative problem-solving and a thirst for adventure. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and social impact, which led me to pursue programming and design. I'm all about having fun and making a difference, whether it's through hacking on a cool project or organizing events that bring people together. Can't wait to collaborate with fellow innovators and make some unforgettable memories at this datathon!
