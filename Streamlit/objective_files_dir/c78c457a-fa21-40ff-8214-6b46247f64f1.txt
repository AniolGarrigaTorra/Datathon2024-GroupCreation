For me, it's all about soaking up the datathon vibes and connecting with fellow enthusiasts. I'm looking to make some new friends who share my passion for programming and data, while having an absolute blast. I'm not too worried about winning, as I've got my coding chops down pat - it's all about learning new things and having an amazing experience! I want to participate in as many events as possible, attend workshops, join challenges, and soak up all the datathon goodness. Let's get this party started and make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Alejandra Rose, a third-year student by day and coding enthusiast by night. I'm all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with programming and data. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me exploring the intersection of AI, AR, and ecommerce. I'm a curious learner with a passion for innovation and a knack for connecting with fellow tech lovers. I'm excited to soak up the datathon vibes, attend workshops, and make some unforgettable memories with fellow participants. Can't wait to meet you all!
