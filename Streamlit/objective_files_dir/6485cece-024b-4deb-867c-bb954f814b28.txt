Hey there! I'm Camila, and I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon. Honestly, I'm not super competitive or experienced in programming (yet!), but I'm all about having a blast and meeting new people. I'm hoping to learn new skills, of course, but my main goal is to make some unforgettable memories with fellow participants. I want to jump into every workshop, panel, and hack-a-thon I can, mingle with other attendees, and soak up as much knowledge and fun as possible. Let's make this datathon an adventure to remember! Hey! I'm Camila, a curious and adventurous 19-year-old student, and I'm super excited to be here! I'm still learning the ropes of programming, but I'm all about diving in and exploring new frontiers. My favorite topics to geek out about are databases, communication, and cybersecurity. When I'm not studying, you can find me tinkering with IoT projects or trying to make a difference through social good. I'm hoping to level up my skills, make new friends, and create unforgettable memories - let's make this datathon one for the books!
