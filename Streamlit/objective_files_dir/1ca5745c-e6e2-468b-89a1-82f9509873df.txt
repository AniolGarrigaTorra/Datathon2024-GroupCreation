My objective for this datathon is crystal clear: I'm here to win. I've participated in two hackathons before, and I've loved the thrill of the competition. I'm always up for a challenge and I'm confident that my programming skills and analytical mindset will help me stand out. My goal is to dive headfirst into the challenges, work meticulously, and create something truly impressive. I want to show everyone what I'm capable of and take home that top prize. Bring it on! Hey! I'm Alessia, a 19-year-old university student who's always up for a challenge. When I'm not in class, you can find me exploring the world of tech, designing the next big thing or cracking codes. I've had a blast participating in hackathons before and I'm pumped to do it again. I thrive under pressure, and I'm all about building something from scratch. I'm super curious, love problem-solving, and hate giving up on a puzzle. I'm here to give it my all and make some noise at this datathon! Let's get this party started!
