As a student, I've had my fair share of stressful deadlines and lonely coffee breaks. For this datathon, I'm excited to shift my focus from coding all alone to connecting with like-minded individuals! My goal is to soak up the collaborative atmosphere, make some unforgettable friends, and have a blast while doing it. I'm all about exploring new tech opportunities, attending workshops, and jumping into exciting challenges. I don't need to win; I just want to revel in the thrill of innovation, and walk away with some amazing stories to share with my loved ones. Hey there! I'm Sofia, a PhD student by day and a coding enthusiast by night. I'm all about collaborative vibes and good times, so I'm stoked to be here for the datathon. My background is in programming, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine tech with my passions. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me jamming to music, trying out new art supplies, or geeking out over the latest healthcare breakthroughs. I'm all about creating unforgettable experiences and making new friends - let's have some fun and shape the future together!
