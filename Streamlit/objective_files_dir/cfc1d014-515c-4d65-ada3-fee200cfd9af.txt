Hey! So, my goal for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge and skills as I can. I'm just starting out with programming and I'm eager to learn from other experienced participants and mentors. I'm really interested in exploring new technologies and techniques, and I'm hoping to gain a better understanding of how they can be applied to real-world problems. I'd love to learn new programming languages, improve my coding skills, and maybe even discover a new area of interest that I hadn't thought about before. It's all about learning and growth for me! Hi everyone! I'm Emily Rachel Wells, a curious and enthusiastic 18-year-old student. I'm starting my first year of university and eager to learn as much as I can. I've dabbled in programming, but I'm still a beginner. For me, this datathon is about more than just coding - it's about discovering new technologies, exploring creative applications, and tackling real-world problems. I'm excited to learn from others, share my own ideas, and make new connections. Let's learn and grow together!
