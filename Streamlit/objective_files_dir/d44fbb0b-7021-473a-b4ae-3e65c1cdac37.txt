As Ana Elena Brooks, my primary objective for this datathon is to challenge myself and continuously improve my skills. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into new technologies and learning from the best in the field. I hope to come out of this experience with a fresh set of skills, a broader understanding of how to approach complex problems, and the confidence to take on bigger projects. For me, it's not about the prize or winning, but about what I can learn and apply in the real world. I'm excited to absorb knowledge and grow as a developer. Hi there!
