My main goal is to bring home that top prize! I'm pumped to push myself to the limit and showcase my skills. I've had some experience with programming, but I know I can do even better with the right challenge. I'm hoping to refine my coding skills and problem-solving strategies under the pressure of a datathon. The adrenaline rush of competing against other talented participants gets me excited, and I'm ready to put in the hard work necessary to take home the win. Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 17-year-old newbie with a passion for coding and innovation. As a first-year student, I've had a taste of the programming world and I'm hooked! When I'm not in class, you can find me exploring the intersection of technology and social good. I'm all about harnessing tech to make a positive impact. For this datathon, I'm aiming to push my skills to the next level and come out on top. I'm excited to challenge myself and learn from others - bring it on!
