My objective for this datathon is to come out on top! I've got my game face on and I'm ready to give it my all. I've participated in five hackathons before, and I've learned that to win, you have to put in the work. I'm determined to improve my skills, stay ahead of the competition, and deliver a project that wows the judges. I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to be the best, and I'm willing to put in the long hours to make it happen. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Lluïsa Elizabeth Fernández, a 21-year-old student ready to take on the datathon. I've been honing my coding skills through various hackathons and I'm eager to put them to the test. As a communication enthusiast, I love solving real-world problems and making an impact. My passion for Fintech and Databases drives my fascination with data and its potential. For this datathon, I'm gunning for the top spot - I'm all about innovation, hard work, and self-improvement. Bring on the challenge and let's get this data party started!
