Hey there! As Maria Sofia Rodriguez, my objective for this datathon is to make new friends, have a blast, and participate in as many events as possible! I'm all about keeping it chill and social, so I want to connect with fellow enthusiasts and geek out with the techy squad. I'm not worried about winning (although it'd be cool, who knows?), my main goal is to enjoy the experience and take in as much as I can. If I happen to learn something new or grow as a programmer, even better! But let's keep it casual, fun, and vibing high! Hey everyone! I'm Maria Sofia, a third-year student with a passion for making things fun and learning as I go. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming with my squad or trying to tap into my artistic side. My friends would describe me as a curious and chill person who loves being around others. I'm stoked to be a part of this datathon, where I can hang out with like-minded folk, learn something new, and just have a blast!
