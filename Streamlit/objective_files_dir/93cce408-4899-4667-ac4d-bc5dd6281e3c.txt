For me, this datathon is all about growth and self-improvement. I'm excited to dive into new technologies and challenges, learning from my peers and mentors. My main objective is to enhance my problem-solving skills and expand my knowledge in data science and machine learning. I'm looking forward to experimenting with different approaches, and getting out of my comfort zone. Through this datathon, I hope to develop a stronger foundation in my degree and become a more skilled programmer, ultimately setting myself up for success in my future career. Hi there! I'm Aurora Englishesi, a third-year student looking to dive into the world of data science and machine learning. I'm all about growth and self-improvement, and this datathon is my chance to challenge myself and learn from the best. I've had a solid foundation in programming through my degree, and I'm eager to apply that knowledge to real-world problems. I'm excited to work with my peers and mentors to push my boundaries and develop a stronger skillset. I'm looking forward to the creative problem-solving and making memories along the way!
