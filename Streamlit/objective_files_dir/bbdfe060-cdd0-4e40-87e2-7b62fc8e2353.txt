My objective for this datathon is to focus on learning and skill-building. As a 3rd-year student with some experience in programming, I want to take this opportunity to step up my game and tackle new challenges. I'm eager to learn from industry experts, dive deeper into emerging technologies, and apply my skills to real-world problems. I'm looking to level up my coding skills, expand my problem-solving capabilities, and gain a deeper understanding of the latest trends in data science. I'm excited to learn from others and contribute to a collaborative atmosphere that fosters growth and knowledge-sharing! Hi! I'm Sofia Valencia, a 20-year-old student enthusiast, in my third year of university. I've been diving into programming for a while now, and I'm excited to take on new challenges at this datathon. I'm a creative problem solver, always looking for ways to apply my skills to real-world problems. Outside of code, I'm a music and art aficionado, always searching for new inspiration. For this datathon, I'm aiming to level up my skills, learn from industry experts, and gain hands-on experience in emerging tech. I'm thrilled to be part of this collaborative space, ready to grow and learn together!
