Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to improve my skills and learn new things. As a 20-year-old student, I'm always looking to challenge myself and expand my skillset. I'm intermediate in programming, but I'm eager to learn more advanced concepts and apply them to real-world projects. I'm not competing to win, I just want to stay focused on what I'm learning and come out with a better understanding of data analysis and visualization. My goal is to take away some new skills and a fresh perspective on how to approach problems. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and pushing my limits. Currently, I'm in my third year of studies, and I'm excited to dive into the world of datathon. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and its impact on real-world problems. I'm looking forward to exploring new concepts, refining my skills, and applying them to practical projects. My ultimate goal is to stay focused on the learning process, take away new skills, and emerge with a fresh perspective on problem-solving. I'm ready to put in the work and see where this datathon takes me!
