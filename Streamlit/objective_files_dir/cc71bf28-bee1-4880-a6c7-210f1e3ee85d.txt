Hey, I'm Leandra! My objective for this datathon is to bring home that first-place prize. I'm a competitive person, and I thrive under pressure. I've already participated in three hackathons, so I know what it takes to deliver a winning project. I'm looking forward to the challenge, and I'm confident in my abilities. I'll be dedicating my time to researching, coding, and perfecting my entry. The goal is to impress the judges and take the top spot. Nothing less will do for me! Hey there! I'm Leandra, a 19-year-old student always up for a challenge. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me coding away or jamming out to some tunes. I've got a bit of competitive fire burning within me, which is why I'm excited to participate in this datathon. With a strong foundation in programming and a passion for innovative projects, I'm ready to take on whatever obstacles come my way. Bring on the thrill of creation and the pursuit of that top spot - I'm in it to win it!
