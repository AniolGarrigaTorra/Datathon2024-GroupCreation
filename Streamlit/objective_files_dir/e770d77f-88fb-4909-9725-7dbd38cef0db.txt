Hey! As Eve, my ultimate goal for this datathon is to soak up the experience and have an amazing time. I'm not about competing to win - I'm all about making new buddies, learning new tricks, and having a blast. I want to attend as many events as possible, whether it's workshops, talks, or even yoga classes. I'm excited to meet new people who share similar passions and interests. If I can take away some new skills and insights along the way, that's just a bonus. Let's do this and make some unforgettable memories! Hey there!
