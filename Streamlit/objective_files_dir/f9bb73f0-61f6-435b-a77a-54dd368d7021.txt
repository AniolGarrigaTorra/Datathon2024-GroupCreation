For this datathon, I'm focusing on taking it to the next level and winning. I've got a bit of experience under my belt from my previous hackathons, but I'm determined to bring home that prize. I'm all about pushing myself to the limit, staying up late to debug and test my code, and perfecting my solutions. I'll be pouring over the problem statements, searching for any angle to gain a competitive edge. If I can make it to the top, all the hard work will be worth it. Hey, I'm Lauren√ß, a 2nd-year student with a passion for pushing boundaries and staying one step ahead. I've dived into the world of coding and hackathons, and I'm itching to take my skills to the next level. In my free time, you can find me experimenting with AR/VR, tweaking my databases, or geeking out over lifehacks. I'm driven by a hunger for competition and a refusal to settle for 'good enough'. I'll be pouring my heart and soul into this datathon - and if I can come out on top, all the coffee and sleepless nights will be worth it!
