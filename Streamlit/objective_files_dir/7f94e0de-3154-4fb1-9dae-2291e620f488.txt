Hey, I'm Aurora! For this datathon, I'm all about the vibes. I'm not here to crush it or stress about winning - I just want to have a blast with new people! I'm looking forward to participating in as many events as possible, from workshops to tech talks. I'd love to make some awesome friends who share my passions and interests. By the end of this datathon, I hope to have made meaningful connections and had an unforgettable experience. Bring on the fun and the coding, and let's get this party started! Hi there! I'm Aurora Sofia, a 26-year-old PhD student and coding enthusiast. When I'm not buried in books or screens, you can find me daydreaming about how technology can make a positive impact on the world. I'm stoked to be here for this datathon, where I get to geek out with fellow enthusiasts and collaborate on projects that get my creative juices flowing. My favorite things in life are good conversations, excellent coffee, and writing lines of code that bring joy to people's lives. Can't wait to meet you and start this coding adventure together!
