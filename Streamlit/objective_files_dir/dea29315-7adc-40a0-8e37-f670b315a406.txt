Hey there! As Elisabeth KÃ¼hnel, my objective for this datathon is crystal clear: I'm all about bringing home that win! I've got my sights set on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the sweat equity to make it happen. With my solid foundation in programming and experience from a previous hackathon, I'm confident in my abilities. This competition is all about testing my skills, pushing myself to the limit, and outdoing my fellow participants. I'm ready to dig deep, stay focused, and give it my all to come out on top. Hey there! I'm Elisabeth, a 20-year-old student on a mission to unleash my passion for problem-solving. With a background in programming, I'm always eager to take on new challenges. I've had a taste of hackathon success and I'm hooked! I love the energy, the rush of adrenaline, and the sense of accomplishment when I land a prize-worthy project. I'm all about making a positive impact, whether through design, technology, or creativity. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes or whipping up a mean cup of coffee. Ready to shake things up and have fun!
