My objective for this datathon is to bring home the win! I've participated in a few hackathons before, and I'm always itching for that rush of adrenaline that comes with solving a tough problem under a tight deadline. I'm not here to mess around - I want to work closely with my teammates to identify a solution that genuinely improves people's lives, and then convince the judges to recognize our hard work. I'm in it to win it, and I'm ready to pour all my energy into making that happen. Hi, I'm Sof√≠a! I'm a third-year student with a passion for solving real-world problems. I've dabbled in coding for a while now, and I've realized that I love being part of something that can actually make a difference in people's lives. I'm excited to join this datathon with the goal of creating something that tackles a pressing issue. With my skills in hand, I'm ready to dig into some cool tech and come up with innovative solutions. I'm a bit of a competitor, so I hope to take home the win - but ultimately, I'm all about making an impact!
