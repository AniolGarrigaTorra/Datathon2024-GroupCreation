My goal for this datathon is to let loose and have a blast! I'm not too worried about competing to win - I've done my fair share of hackathons in the past and I'm happy to just enjoy the ride. I'm really looking forward to meeting new people, learning from them, and just generally having a great time. I want to participate in all the events, attend workshops, and maybe even try out some new skills or tools. Let's make some unforgettable memories, stay chill, and maybe just stumble upon something amazing in the process! Hey there! I'm Lena, a 22-year-old student with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. I've dived into programming with intermediate-level expertise, and I'm always eager to dive deeper. This datathon is more about having a blast with fellow geeks than winning - I'm here to soak up knowledge, explore new tech, and create unforgettable memories. As a creative thinker, I'm stoked to try out fresh ideas and learn from others. Ready to roll up my sleeves and take on whatever the datathon throws our way!
