Hey, I'm Sophia! My goal for this datathon is to crush it and come out on top. I'm all about that competitive spirit, and I'm coming in ready to give it my all. I'm not just here to have a good time or network (although, don't get me wrong, those are important too!), but to take home that shiny trophy and show off my mad programming skills. I've been to seven hackathons before, and I've learned what it takes to win. So, expect to see me pouring over lines of code, sipping coffee, and maybe, just maybe, losing my sanity in the process. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Sophia Alba Wei√ü, a 20-year-old student and seasoned hacker. I've got a passion for creating innovative solutions that make a real impact. With a strong foundation in programming, I'm always on the lookout for the next big challenge. When I'm not sipping coffee and coding away, you can find me jamming to electronic music or working on digital art projects. I'm competitive, resourceful, and always up for a good debate. For this datathon, I'm laser-focused on taking home that trophy and showing off my skills - bring it on, I'm ready!
