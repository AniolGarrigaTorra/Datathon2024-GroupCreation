Hey there! So, I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon and I'm all about learning and growing. My objective is to dive into this datathon as an opportunity to improve my programming skills and learn new techniques, tools, and methodologies. I'm hoping to tackle challenging projects, take on constructive feedback, and expand my skillset. I want to emerge from this datathon a better coder, with a fresh perspective and renewed enthusiasm for tech. It's going to be an awesome experience, and I'm looking forward to the ride! Hi! I'm Éléna, a 19-year-old student, and I'm thrilled to be here at the datathon. I'm currently honing my programming skills, with a beginner's passion for coding. When I'm not scribbling away in code, I love creating music and art. This datathon is all about growth and improvement for me - I'm excited to tackle challenging projects, learn from experts, and expand my skillset. I'm looking forward to meeting amazing people and walking away with a fresh perspective. Bring on the creativity and code-crafting, I'm ready for this adventure!
