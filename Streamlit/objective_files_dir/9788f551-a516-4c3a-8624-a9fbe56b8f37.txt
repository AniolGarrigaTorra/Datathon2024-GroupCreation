My objective for this datathon is to take a huge leap forward in my coding skills. I've been participating in hackathons since college, and while I've had a blast, I feel like I've plateaued a bit. I'm looking forward to diving into new technologies, learning from fellow participants, and pushing my skills to the next level. I'm not worried about winning or getting stressed out - just pure learning and growth. Bring on the challenges and opportunities to develop my skills and become a better programmer! Hey there! I'm Sofía García López, a 20-year-old student looking to level up my coding game. I've been participating in hackathons since my college days, and while I've had an amazing time, I feel like I've reached a plateau. I'm all about learning, growing, and expanding my skillset - new tech, new challenges, you name it! I'm stoked to be part of this datathon and explore innovative projects with like-minded folks. My aim is to learn from the best, make new connections, and become a better programmer. Bring on the fun and the code, and let's do this!
