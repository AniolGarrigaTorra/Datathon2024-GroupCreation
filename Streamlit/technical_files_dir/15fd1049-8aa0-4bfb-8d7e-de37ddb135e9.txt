I'm proud to mention that I worked on a project called EcoLife during my junior year. It was a mobile application that helps users track and reduce their daily environmental impact. I designed the UI/UX, developed the backend using PostgreSQL, and built the Android app using Java. It was an amazing experience working on a real-world problem that aligns with my passion for Social Good. Seeing users adopt sustainable habits and providing a platform for communities to come together to make a difference was incredibly fulfilling. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions for edTech. Specifically, I envision creating an AI-powered educational platform that leverages machine learning and IoT to personalize learning experiences for underprivileged children. This platform would collect data on students' learning habits, environment, and socio-economic conditions to deliver tailored lessons, mentorship, and real-time feedback. I aim to collaborate with educators, NGOs, and governments to make quality education accessible and impactful worldwide. It's a lofty goal, but I'm confident that my skills in UI/UX design, Android development, and data analysis will be crucial in making this vision a reality.
