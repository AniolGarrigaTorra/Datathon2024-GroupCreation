One project that really stands out to me is a simple robot I built using Raspberry Pi and Java programming. It was a small robotic arm that could pick up small objects and move them around. What I enjoyed most was learning about IoT and implementing sensor technology to enable the robot to interact with its environment. Seeing my robot move and respond to commands was an incredible feeling! It was a great way to blend my interest in robotics with programming, and I was surprised by how easy it was to pick up Java and get started with robotics. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionated about the convergence of health and technology. In the next 10 years, I dream of developing an AI-powered, blockchain-based healthcare platform that enables patients to securely share their medical records, treatments, and test results with healthcare providers. This platform would not only enhance data accessibility and integrity but also reduce costs, improve diagnosis accuracy, and empower personalized medicine. With my background in programming and interest in health, I believe I can contribute to this innovation and positively impact the lives of millions.
