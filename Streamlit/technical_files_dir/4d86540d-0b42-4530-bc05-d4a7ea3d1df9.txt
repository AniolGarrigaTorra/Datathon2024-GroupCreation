I'd have to say my favorite project so far was building a voice-controlled AI pet assistant for Android using Rust and Figma. I loved exploring the intersection of machine learning and UI/UX design to create a seamless user experience. The project challenged me to develop my problem-solving skills and forced me to dig deep into my technical know-how. I enjoyed the thrill of bringing my vision to life, watching it come together, and sharing it with friends and family who thought it was pretty cool. The excitement that comes with envisioning a better future! Over the next decade, I'm incredibly stoked to work on developing innovative health monitoring solutions using Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. I envision wearables that can monitor vital signs and detect potential health issues before they become severe, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals worldwide. This aligns with my interests in Health and Cybersecurity, allowing me to combine my technical skills with my passion for improving human lives. Who knows, maybe one day my work can revolutionize the healthcare industry and save countless lives!
