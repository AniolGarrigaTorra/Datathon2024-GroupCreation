I had a blast working on a personal AR/VR project, creating a interactive art gallery that used facial recognition and Machine Learning algorithms to identify and display art pieces that match the user's mood. I implemented the AR features using ARKit and MLKit on Unity, and then connected it to a RESTful API. The result was a mesmerizing experience that amazed my friends! It was a great learning opportunity for me, and I enjoyed experimenting with different techniques and tools. The creative freedom and problem-solving aspects of this project really sparked my enthusiasm! As a tech enthusiast, I'm thrilled to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of augmented reality (AR) experiences that not only revolutionize the way we live, work, and play but also have a profound impact on society. Imagine an AR-enhanced education system that makes learning more interactive, immersive, and accessible to everyone. Or, a global platform that leverages AR to enable people with disabilities to communicate and connect with the world in new and powerful ways. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to be a part of shaping this exciting future!
