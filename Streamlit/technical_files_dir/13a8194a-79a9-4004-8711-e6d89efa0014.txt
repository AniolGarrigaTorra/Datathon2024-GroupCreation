I had a blast working on a music visualization project using AR/VR technologies. I was tasked with creating an immersive experience that allowed users to see their favorite songs come to life in 3D. I used React Native and Docker to build the application, and combined it with some neat machine learning tricks to generate the visualizations in real-time. Seeing my friends and family's reactions when they put on the VR headsets was amazing - it was like they were witnessing a new dimension being born! It was an incredible feeling to see my creation bring people joy. As a datathon participant, I'm thrilled to be at the forefront of innovations that reshape the future. In the next 10 years, I'm ecstatic to work on developing Artificial Intelligence-powered personal fashion assistants. Imagine having a virtual stylist that learns your style, preferences, and body type, then suggests tailored outfit recommendations, ensuring you look your best for any occasion. This technology has the potential to disrupt the retail industry, create new business models, and enhance people's self-confidence. I'd be honored to be a part of a team revolutionizing the way we shop and present ourselves to the world.
