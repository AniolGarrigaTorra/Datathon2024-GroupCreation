One project that stands out to me is a mobile app I built in my second year of studies, a fitness tracker for people with chronic illnesses. As someone who has personal experience with chronic health issues, I was motivated to create something that could help others stay on top of their medication schedules and track their physical activity. Using my iOS development skills, I designed a user-friendly app that sends customizable reminders and connects users with certified health coaches. Seeing the positive impact it had on my peers made the project incredibly rewarding. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about revolutionizing education through IoT and AI. Within the next decade, I envision developing an intelligent, wearable device that leverages machine learning to optimize learning experiences for students. This device would continuously monitor students' brain activity, emotions, and attention levels, adapting its content and presentation style to individual needs. The potential is enormous - empowering teachers to provide personalized feedback, enabling students to learn at their own pace, and ultimately bridging the gap between traditional education and the rapidly evolving world of technology.
