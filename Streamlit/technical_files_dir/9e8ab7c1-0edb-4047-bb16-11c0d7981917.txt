I had an absolute blast working on a project that combined my passions for AR/VR and E-commerce! I created an AR-powered virtual try-on experience for a fashion e-commerce platform. Using React Native, TensorFlow, and ARKit, I developed a mobile app that allowed users to virtually try on clothing and accessories in 3D. The most exciting part was seeing the reactions of friends and family when they tried it out - they loved how it made trying on clothes feel more immersive and interactive! It was a great challenge, and I learned so much from it. I'm thrilled to be working on transforming the way we interact with fashion in the next decade! As someone with a passion for retail and e-commerce, I envision a future where augmented reality (AR) allows customers to virtually try on clothes and accessories, revolutionizing the shopping experience. Imagine walking into a store, trying on a digital version of a dress without disturbing the original piece, and being able to try different styles and sizes effortlessly. It's an innovative solution that combines IoT, AR, and AI to enhance customer satisfaction and make shopping more sustainable. That's my dream project!
