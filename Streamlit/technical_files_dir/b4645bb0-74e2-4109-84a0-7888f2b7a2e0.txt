I had an absolute blast working on a VR game dev project during my summer break. We created an immersive game where players navigate through a fantasy world, collecting treasures while avoiding obstacles. I was responsible for implementing the environmental effects and character animations. It was my first time using Unity, and I was amazed by how much I could create without being a pro at coding. The non-technical members of the team were mind-blown by the game's realism, and it was surreal seeing our design concepts come to life. We even presented it at a local game dev meetup, and received some great feedback! What a thrilling question! As I gaze into the crystal ball, I'm excited to contribute to the development of Augmented Reality (AR) education. I envision a world where immersive learning experiences revolutionize the way we learn. By 2030, I hope to see AR-enabled interactive whiteboards, personal learning devices, or even implantable AR contact lenses that can enhance education for people of all ages. My dream is to collaborate with educators and researchers to create engaging, accessible, and personalized learning pathways, ultimately bridging the gap between technology and human understanding. Bring on the AR frontier!
