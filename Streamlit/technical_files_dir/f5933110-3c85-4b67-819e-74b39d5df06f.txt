I recently worked on a non-technical project that allowed me to flex my creative muscles - a VR photography experience for a local art exhibition! I collaborated with friends from different majors to bring this project to life. We built a VR app that allowed viewers to immerse themselves in an artist's world, with interactive art pieces and stunning visuals. It was a blast seeing people's reactions when they first experienced it! Although I didn't write any code for it, I got to utilize my experience with AR/VR and even learned some new design skills. I'm thrilled to think about what's next! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing an AI-powered, augmented reality-based mental health platform for young adults. This platform would utilize machine learning to analyze user data, provide personalized coping mechanisms, and connect individuals with mental health professionals for remote consultations. I believe that by leveraging emerging technologies like AR and AI, we can bridge the gap between mental health services and those who need them most. This dream project not only combines my technical skills with my passion for health but also allows me to contribute to a meaningful cause.
