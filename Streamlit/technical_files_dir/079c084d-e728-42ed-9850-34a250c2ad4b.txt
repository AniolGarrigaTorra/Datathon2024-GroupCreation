I had a blast working on a project to create an IoT-enabled smart home system using React and React Native. I hacked together a simple Arduino-based temperature control device that connected to my home Wi-Fi and allowed me to adjust the temperature from my phone or Alexa. It was awesome to see how I could integrate different components and watch my idea come to life. I loved learning about the intersection of hardware and software, and it's definitely a skill I'd like to continue honing. The feeling of controlling my room's temperature with just my voice is just too cool! The thought of what I'd love to work on in the next 10 years gets me pumped! As an enthusiast of AI and Machine Learning, I'm eager to dive into creating personalized medicine using Quantum Computing and Natural Language Processing. Imagine being able to tailor medical treatment plans to an individual's unique genetic profile, using AI to analyze vast amounts of healthcare data, and leveraging Quantum Computing to simulate complex biological processes. It's a revolutionary concept that could transform the healthcare landscape. The Datathon is just the starting point for me - I'm ready to lay the foundation for a breakthrough!
