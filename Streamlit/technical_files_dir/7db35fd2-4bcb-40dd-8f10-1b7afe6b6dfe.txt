I recently developed a mobile app, FitBuddy, using iOS Development and Figma. It was a non-technical project, and I co-created it with friends who were fitness enthusiasts. The app helped users track their workout routines, monitor their progress, and receive personalized motivational messages. I was thrilled to see how a simple idea could transform into something tangible and useful. The experience taught me the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and empathy in product design. I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing innovative voice-driven retail solutions that revolutionize the way people shop. Imagine walking into a store and using a custom-built smart glass cabinet that can recognize and respond to your voice, helping you find the perfect outfit or product with minimal effort. I envision partnering with e-commerce giants to create seamless online-offline retail experiences, leveraging technologies like PyTorch and UI/UX design to create user-friendly interfaces. It's a future where voice becomes the new norm, and I'm pumped to be a part of it!
