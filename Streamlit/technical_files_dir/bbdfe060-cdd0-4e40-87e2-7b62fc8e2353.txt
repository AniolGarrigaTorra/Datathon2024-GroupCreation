I had a blast working on a non-technical project - a music festival I helped organize during my sophomore year. I was in charge of designing the festival's branding, from the logo to the social media graphics. I used Figma to create the visuals, and even designed a mobile app to guide attendees through the event. It was amazing to see my designs come to life! It was a fantastic experience that helped me develop my creative problem-solving skills and understand the importance of user experience in design. Plus, it was super fun to see people enjoying the festival with my designs. As I look to the future, I'm truly thrilled at the prospect of contributing to the development of innovative healthcare technologies. I envision a world where AI-powered medical devices, integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT), can continuously monitor patients' vital signs, detecting potential health issues before they arise. I'm excited to explore the integration of natural language processing, blockchain, and data visualization to create personalized treatment plans, streamline medical records, and enhance patient care. The potential for positive impact is tremendous, and I'm eager to be a part of this movement as it takes shape over the next decade.
