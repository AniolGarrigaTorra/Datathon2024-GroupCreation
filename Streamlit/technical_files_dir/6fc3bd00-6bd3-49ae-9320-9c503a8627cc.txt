I've always been obsessed with trying new things, and a project that stood out to me was when I built an AI-powered to-do list app using Flutter and TensorFlow. I spent hours figuring out how to implement natural language processing to recognize voice commands, and it was so satisfying when I got it working! Not only did I get to learn new skills, but it was also super cool to hear myself saying Hey, Alexia! Add milk to grocery list and seeing the app respond instantly. It was a fun way to combine my love for programming, AI, and voice skills. I'm stoked to say that in the next 10 years, I'd love to be working on a scalable, AI-powered health platform that utilizes blockchain technology to safeguard patient data. The platform would utilize machine learning to analyze individual health trends, provide personalized wellness recommendations, and enable secure data sharing between healthcare providers. I'd also be excited to contribute to the development of voice-controlled, user-friendly interfaces that make healthcare more accessible for people of all ages. The potential to make a significant impact on public health while also pushing the boundaries of technology has me excited!
