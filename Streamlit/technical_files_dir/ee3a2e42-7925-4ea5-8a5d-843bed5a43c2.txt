I've always had a blast working on my own personal project, Beatz, a music discovery platform that uses machine learning to recommend songs based on a user's listening history and preferences. I had a great time designing the UI, learning about music APIs, and experimenting with data analysis to fine-tune the algorithm. It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to combine my passions for music and programming. Plus, it was awesome to see friends and family trying out the app and getting recommendations that actually worked for them! I'm thrilled to envision myself crafting innovative, AI-powered healthcare applications that revolutionize patient care and outcomes. In the next 10 years, I dream of developing personalized medicine platforms that leverage predictive analytics, machine learning, and data visualization to empower patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals alike. My goal is to contribute to a more preventative, patient-centric healthcare system that streamlines care coordination, streamlines medical research, and ultimately saves lives. It's an ambitious goal, but I believe the potential for positive impact is limitless, and I'm excited to dedicate myself to making it a reality.
