I loved working on a personal project where I built a smart home security system using Rust and React. It was my first real-world application of IoT and DevOps, and I was thrilled to see my skills come together. The project involved designing and implementing a web interface to monitor and control sensors and cameras, as well as creating a backend system to process and store data. I enjoyed the challenge of balancing different aspects of the project, and it was a great way to learn new technologies while having fun and experimenting with creative solutions. I'm thrilled to think about the exciting projects that lie ahead. In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on a sustainable smart home system that integrates IoT, AI, and renewable energy sources to create an efficient and eco-friendly living space. As a developer, I'm excited to design and implement a seamless user experience, leveraging technologies like Rust and React, to manage energy consumption, automate tasks, and even provide personalized health and wellness recommendations. This ambitious project aligns with my passion for IoT, DevOps, and cybersecurity, and the potential to positively impact people's daily lives keeps me energized and motivated.
