One project that I really enjoyed working on was creating a chatbot using Flutter! I've always been fascinated by the idea of making conversational AI accessible to everyone, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to build one. I learned a lot about natural language processing, API integration, and state management. My chatbot, which I named Mozzie, can have simple conversations and answer basic questions. Seeing Mozzie come to life was incredibly satisfying, and I'm excited to keep improving her abilities and maybe even open-sourcing her. It was an amazing feeling to see something I created interact with people! As a student with a passion for data analysis and social good, I'm excited to work on innovative solutions that can positively impact marginalized communities. Specifically, I'm eager to develop AI-powered virtual assistants that can effectively communicate with people with disabilities, helping them access essential services and information. My goal is to create a system that can provide real-time language translation, emotional support, and personalized assistance. By combining my interests in computer vision, data analysis, and Voice skills, I envision a technology that can bridge the gap and create a more inclusive and equitable society.
