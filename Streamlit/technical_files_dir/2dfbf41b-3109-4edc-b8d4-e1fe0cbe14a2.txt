I loved working on a Fintech project where I created a chatbot using Natural Language Processing to help small business owners with expense tracking and budgeting. It was my first major project, and I was thrilled to apply my skills in TypeScript and MongoDB to build a functional prototype. The project wasn't without its challenges, but seeing the chatbot come to life and receive positive feedback from beta testers was an amazing feeling. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and proved to me that I can tackle complex technical tasks and make a meaningful impact with my work. As a student of tech, I've always been fascinated by the potential of FinTech to transform the way we live and work. My dream project is to create an AI-powered financial assistant that utilizes blockchain and IoT technology to manage our daily expenses, investments, and financial goals. I envision an app that not only tracks our spending habits but also predicts our financial needs, offers personalized advice, and executes transactions seamlessly. I'm thrilled about the prospect of building something that can positively impact millions of people's lives, and I believe the datathon is the perfect platform to get me started.
