I had a blast building a simple web crawler using Rust and C++ last summer! I wanted to create a tool that could scrape recipes from a specific food blog and compile them into a database. It was my first project outside of schoolwork, and I loved the feeling of creating something from scratch. I learned a ton about networking, parsing HTML, and handling different data structures. The end result was a functional web crawler that could collect recipes and save them to a database - it was super rewarding to see it in action! What an thrilling prospect! In the next 10 years, I'm envisioning a groundbreaking project that combines my passions for gaming, education, and databases. I'm excited to design an AI-powered educational platform that uses immersive, role-playing-style game mechanics to make complex learning concepts accessible and engaging for students worldwide. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and real-time data analytics, the platform would dynamically adapt to each student's learning style, providing personalized feedback and tracking progress. My ultimate goal is to empower the next generation of critical thinkers, problem-solvers, and leaders by making education a thrilling and transformative experience.
