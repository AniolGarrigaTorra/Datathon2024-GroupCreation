Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share this with you! Last semester, I worked on a project that combined my love for Quantum and Education - I created a educational AR/VR experience using React to teach kids about Schr√∂dinger's cat! It was a game-changer for me because it was my first experience with React, and seeing the magic happen when kids would put on the VR headsets and learn about superposition was absolutely insane! It was a huge project, but the feedback I got from the kids and their parents was incredible, and it totally re-energized my passion for coding! I'm thrilled to share my long-term goal with you! As I explore the realm of data science, I'm eager to revolutionize the way we approach education. In the next decade, I'd love to develop a cutting-edge, immersive AR/VR platform that makes complex concepts more accessible and engaging for students. By harnessing the power of data, artificial intelligence, and creative design, I envision an interactive learning environment that enhances cognitive development and sparks curiosity in students of all ages. My ultimate dream is to see this innovation transform the face of education, empowering the next generation to become the change-makers of tomorrow.
