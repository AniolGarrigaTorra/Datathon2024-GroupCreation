I had a blast working on a group project in my design class, where we created an augmented reality exhibition space for a local museum. I was responsible for creating the interface for visitors to interact with, using Blockchain technology to track user engagement and sentiment analysis. It was amazing to see our concept come to life! We had to navigate some technical hurdles, but the sense of accomplishment when we showcased it was incredible. I learned so much about collaboration and creativity, and I'm excited to apply these skills to more projects in the future! I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I'm eager to contribute to the development of a groundbreaking Augmented Reality healthcare platform. I envision a world where AI-powered AR technology helps patients visualize their healthcare progress, track their vital signs, and receive personalized treatment plans in a seamless, accessible manner. My dream is to join a team that combines medical expertise with innovative tech to revolutionize healthcare outcomes. I hope to bring my passion for programming and interest in health to the forefront, making a positive impact on people's lives and shaping the future of healthcare technology.
