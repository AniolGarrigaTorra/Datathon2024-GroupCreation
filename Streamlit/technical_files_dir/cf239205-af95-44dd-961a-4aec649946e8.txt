I had so much fun working on a music recommendation system project using machine learning. I used TensorFlow to build the model, which was a new skill I wanted to acquire, and Flutter to create the mobile app. The project allowed me to combine my love of music and technology, and I enjoyed seeing the model learn and adapt to my taste in music over time. It was also cool to see my friends and family using the app and getting personalized recommendations. I learned a lot and had a blast working on it, and I'm excited to build more projects like it in the future! I'm really thrilled to share with you a project that's been brewing in my mind for quite some time. As someone who's fascinated by music, art, and technology, I've always wanted to create a platform that combines them all. I envision building an AI-powered virtual art gallery, where visitors can walk through and explore an immersive world of artwork generated by machine learning algorithms. The twist? These algorithms would analyze sound waves, translating music into visual masterpieces in real-time! Imagine experiencing a symphony come alive through swirling colors and shapes, and I'd love to bring this vision to life in the next 10 years. The possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to explore this innovative concept further!
