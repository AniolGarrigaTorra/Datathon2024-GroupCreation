I loved working on a personal project - a smart gardening system using IoT and machine learning! I set up a small green space in my backyard and created a sensor-powered system that tracks temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels. Using Flutter, I built an Android app that shows me real-time data and sends notifications when my plants need watering or pruning. It was amazing to see my plants thrive and learn from the data. I enjoyed combining my passions for IoT, data analysis, and automation to create something practical and fun! I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of tackling climate change mitigation through IoT-driven smart sustainable cities. In the next decade, I hope to be part of a project that develops an artificial intelligence-powered monitoring system, using sensors and real-time data analysis to optimize energy consumption and resource allocation in urban areas. Envisioning cities where technology harmonizes with nature, I'm eager to contribute to this vision by utilizing my skills in data analysis, MongoDB, and Flutter to create intuitive interfaces for city planners and residents. It's a bold ambition, but one that excites me and pushes me to learn and grow every day.
