One project that stands out to me was when I created a virtual reality game for a local charity that focused on promoting environmental awareness. I used Unity to build the game, which allowed players to explore a digital representation of a polluted beach and clean up trash. I enjoyed working on this project because it combined my passions for programming, design, and social good. It was rewarding to see the impact it had on players and the charity, and it pushed me to explore new areas of development, such as 3D modeling and animation. I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of AI-powered smart cities. I envision a future where cities are designed with intelligent infrastructure, sustainable energy systems, and real-time traffic management, all made possible through seamless interactions between humans and machines. I'd love to be part of the team that crafts the algorithms and software that power these systems, integrating computer vision, machine learning, and IoT data to create a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and connected urban landscape. It's a bold goal, but I'm eager to be a part of it!
