I'm absolutely thrilled to share my passion project with you - Melodia, a music- visualization app using Flutter and audio fingerprinting. I love tinkering with sounds and visualizing melodies, it's almost like a meditative experience! I explored libraries like OpenTSX and Audio fingerprinting, created a web scraper to fetch song lyrics, and crafted unique visualization techniques using flutter's dart code. My goal was to create an immersive experience, allowing users to see the rhythm and emotion behind the music. The feeling of bringing art and tech together, watching users enjoy and share their musical stories, was truly incredible! As a creative and tech-savvy individual, I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in the next 10 years. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art, and I envision myself pioneering a new era of interdisciplinary fusion. I dream of developing a futuristic smart city infrastructure that utilizes IoT and blockchain to create a sustainable, self-sufficient, and breathtakingly beautiful environment. The idea of using data visualization and machine learning to craft harmonious soundscapes and vibrant street art installations, driven by citizens' needs and preferences, gets my creative juices flowing.
