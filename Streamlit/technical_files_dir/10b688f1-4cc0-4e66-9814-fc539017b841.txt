I recently completed a passion project where I built a music recommendation system using React Native and TensorFlow. I love music, and I was excited to create an app that could help people discover new tunes. The app uses Computer Vision to analyze song lyrics and recommends tracks based on the mood and genre. It was a thrill to design and build it, and I enjoyed experimenting with different AI models to optimize the recommendations. Now, I'm stoked to think that my app can help music lovers discover new faves! What a great question! In the next decade, I'm incredibly stoked to dive into developing revolutionary healthcare technology that combines blockchain, machine learning, and IoT to enable more accurate and patient-centric care. I envision a future where patients' sensitive medical data is securely stored on a decentralized network, allowing for real-time monitoring and alerts. AI-powered diagnostics could be accelerated by vast amounts of anonymized patient data, leading to improved treatment outcomes and prevention strategies. My ultimate goal is to create a seamless, transparent, and trustable healthcare ecosystem that benefits both patients and medical professionals alike. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to get started on this journey!
