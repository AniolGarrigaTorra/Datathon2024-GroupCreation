Man! I recently worked on a non-technical project, actually a lifehack that I wanted to implement in my daily routine. I created a minimalist planner using a combination of note-taking and doodling. I designed a custom layout in Google Sheets, then used canva to create printable templates. It's been a game-changer! Not only does it help me stay organized, but it's also a great creative outlet. I love how simple it is to customize and add my own flair. It's been a joy to share it with friends and family, too. So, it's been a fun project that combines productivity and creativity! I'm really excited about the prospect of working on projects that combine my passions for Robotics, Quantum Computing, and Cybersecurity. In the next 10 years, I hope to be involved in the development of autonomous systems that can positively impact people's lives. Imagine robots that can assist healthcare professionals in surgeries, or robots that can help us detect and prevent cyber-attacks. I'm also excited about the potential applications of Quantum Computing in solving complex problems, such as in the fields of cryptography and optimization. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!
