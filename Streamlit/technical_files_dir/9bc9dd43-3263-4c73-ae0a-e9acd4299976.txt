I recently worked on a personal project building a robotic arm using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and C++ programming. I've always been fascinated by AI and machine learning, and this project allowed me to explore those interests. I designed and built a robotic arm that could perform simple tasks, like moving a small object from one location to another. What I enjoyed most was watching my idea come to life - it was a great feeling of accomplishment. I documented my progress on social media and got awesome feedback from others, which made it even more satisfying! I'm thrilled to share that I'm eager to continue exploring the realm of Artificial Intelligence and its profound impact on healthcare. Specifically, I'm passionate about developing predictive analytics models to detect and prevent chronic diseases. With the increasing availability of patient data, I believe it's essential to leverage machine learning algorithms to identify early warning signs, optimize treatment plans, and ultimately save lives. Imagine having the ability to predict a patient's likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes based on their genetics, lifestyle, and medical history - the possibilities are truly exciting, and I'm excited to be a part of this groundbreaking innovation.
