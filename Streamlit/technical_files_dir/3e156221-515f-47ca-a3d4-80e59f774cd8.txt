I'm super passionate about music, so I decided to create a project that combines my love for music and coding. I built a web app that uses music recommendation algorithms to suggest songs based on a user's favorite artists and genres. I used Rust to create the backend and Git to manage the project. The web app has a cool design and is easy to use, making it accessible to music lovers of all kinds. I enjoyed the process of researching music recommendation systems, experimenting with different algorithms, and learning how to implement them in Rust. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'd love to be working on sustainable, community-driven projects that use data science to drive positive social change. Imagine developing blockchain-based platforms that empower marginalized communities to own and control their own data, or using machine learning to identify and combat environmental challenges like climate change. With the skills and knowledge I'm gaining, I envision myself as a key contributor to impactful initiatives that merge technology, art, and social justice. It's a lofty goal, but I'm eager to dedicate myself to making a difference.
