I loved working on a non-technical project, Smart Garden! It was a hackathon challenge where I and my team designed a sustainable gardening system using IoT sensors and Arduino. We created a mobile app that monitored soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, and automatically watered and pruned the plants based on these factors. I enjoyed the intersection of technology, sustainability, and design. It was a great way to apply my interests in IoT and social good, and I was proud to see the positive impact it could have on urban green spaces. It was a really cool project! I'm thrilled to say that I've been fascinated by the concept of decentralized, blockchain-based virtual reality experiences, which could revolutionize how we interact, socialize, and even learn. Imagine being able to create and customize your own immersive, augmented reality spaces where users can collaborate, share knowledge, and work together on complex problems. The potential is limitless! With advancements in AI and IoT, I envision a future where this technology becomes a gateway for empathy, understanding, and global unity. As a future computer scientist, I'm eager to contribute to this innovative field and make it a reality.
