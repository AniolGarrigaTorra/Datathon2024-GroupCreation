I'm thrilled to share a project I worked on last summer. It was a mobile app I built using Flutter, combining my interests in AR and Design. The app used augmented reality to transform furniture shopping into an immersive experience. Users could point their camera at a room, and virtually place furniture items to see how they'd fit. I collaborated with a friend, who handled the AR aspect, and I handled the design and coding. We presented it at a local hackathon, and the feedback was amazing! It was a great learning experience, and I loved seeing my idea come to life. I'm absolutely stoked to dive into the world of augmented reality (AR) in the next decade! I've always been fascinated by the potential of AR to transform various industries, from education and healthcare to entertainment and beyond. I envision creating immersive experiences that not only enhance our daily lives but also help solve complex global challenges, such as improving patient outcomes, revolutionizing remote education, or fostering more inclusive social interactions. The prospect of harnessing AR's capabilities to drive positive change keeps me up at night, fueled by an insatiable curiosity to explore its vast possibilities!
