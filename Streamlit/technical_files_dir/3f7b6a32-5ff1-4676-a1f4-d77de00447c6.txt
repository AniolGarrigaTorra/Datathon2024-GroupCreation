I had an absolute blast working on my senior design project - a conversational AI chatbot that helped users find the best coffee shops in town! I used Python and Flask to build the backend, and Flutter for the mobile app. The AI part was a learning curve, but it was so cool to see the algorithm learn from user interactions and adapt to their preferences. Plus, who doesn't love coffee? The project allowed me to combine my interests in AI, ML, and mobile development, and I even got to test it out with my friends and classmates. I'm absolutely thrilled to think about the possibilities that the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of artificial intelligence and its applications in healthcare. Specifically, I'd love to work on developing a revolutionary AI-powered medical diagnosis system that can accurately detect rare diseases with unprecedented precision. Imagine being able to diagnose a patient's condition within minutes, potentially saving countless lives and improving healthcare outcomes. The idea of harnessing AI to make a meaningful impact on people's lives motivates me to push boundaries and make a real difference.
