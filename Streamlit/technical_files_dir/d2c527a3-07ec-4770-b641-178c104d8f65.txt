I'm super passionate about a mobile app I developed as part of a group project during my university's innovation festival. We created a augmented reality (AR) experience that allowed users to learn about urban wildlife in their vicinity. I was responsible for designing the UI/UX, implementing AR features using Flutter, and handling backend operations with Flask. I loved seeing our idea come to life and watching users enjoy the interactive experience. It was a collaborative effort, and I appreciated the opportunity to explore new technologies and showcase our project to a large audience. As I think about the future, I'm thoroughly excited about the prospect of developing an intelligent, portable, and accessible platform that combines AI, AR, and IoT technologies to enhance the daily lives of individuals with disabilities. Imagine a world where people with impaired vision or hearing can effortlessly navigate through public spaces, communicate with their loved ones, and perform daily tasks with greater autonomy. By leveraging my skills in Android Development, TensorFlow, and IoT, I envision creating a seamless, voice-activated, and wearable device that integrates all these technologies to break down barriers and empower those who need it most. The possibilities are endless, and the potential impact is staggering!
