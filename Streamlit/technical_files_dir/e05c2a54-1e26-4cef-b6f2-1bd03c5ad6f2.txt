Oh, oh! I had a blast working on a project called EatWhatYouWant - a food delivery app I built using React Native. It was my first real-world application, and I was determined to learn as much as possible. I researched different APIs, designed the UI, and even integrated a location-based system. Seeing my friends try out the app and receiving positive feedback made all the late-night coding sessions worth it! Plus, who doesn't love food? I'm thrilled to share that I'm super passionate about the convergence of fintech and AI! In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on developing cutting-edge solutions that empower financial institutions to become more agile, efficient, and customer-centric through the use of machine learning and automation. Imagine a future where mobile apps, voice assistants, and social media platforms can seamlessly integrate to provide personalized financial advice, loan approval decisions, and seamless transaction tracking. I'm excited to be at the forefront of this revolution and can already see the endless possibilities unfolding!
