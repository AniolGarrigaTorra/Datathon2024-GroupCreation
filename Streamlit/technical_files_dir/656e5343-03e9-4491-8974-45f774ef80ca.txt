I loved working on a Computer Vision project where I built a prototype for an assistive technology that helps visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings more easily. I used React and OpenCV to develop an application that uses camera input to detect obstacles and provide haptic feedback to the user through their cane. Seeing the prototype in action was incredibly fulfilling, and it made me realize the impact technology can have on people's lives. It was an exciting challenge that combined my interests in Computer Vision, AI, and accessibility. I'm excited to say that in the next 10 years, I aspire to be a leading expert in developing AI-powered solutions that revolutionize the financial services industry. I dream of creating an AI-powered investment platform that leverages machine learning to analyze market trends and provide personalized investment advice to individuals. My platform would utilize blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions, and computer vision for automated account management. The prospect of bringing this concept to life excites me, as it could have a profound impact on empowering individuals to take control of their financial futures.
