One project that really stood out to me was a chatbot I built using React and Flask for a university hackathon. I was the project lead and worked with a team to design and develop an emotional intelligence test for chatbot interactions. We used Computer Vision to analyze user facial expressions and track their emotional responses. It was an incredible feeling to see our project come to life and receive positive feedback from users. We even won first prize! Working on this project allowed me to combine my interests in Fintech, Communication, and Robotic Process Automation - it was a real adrenaline rush! I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I envision myself leading a revolutionary fintech project that combines machine learning, robotic process automation, and computer vision to enhance transaction monitoring and fraud detection capabilities. My dream project, titled Aurora, would utilize real-time data analytics and AI-powered intelligence to streamline financial institutions' operations, reducing manual processes by at least 75%. I'd be the lead architect, overseeing a global team of experts to bring Aurora to life. With my tech stack, including React, PostgreSQL, and Computer Vision expertise, I'm confident that Aurora can make a meaningful impact on the financial sector.
