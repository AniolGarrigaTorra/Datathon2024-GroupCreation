I absolutely loved working on a Natural Language Processing project to generate poetry. I was introduced to the world of language modeling and machine learning algorithms, and it was amazing to see how I could teach a computer to recognize patterns in language and generate coherent poems. I created a Figma design for a virtual art installation that would display the generated poems in a visually appealing way. It was an incredible feeling to see my coding bring the project to life. It was my first foray into NLP, and I'm eager to continue exploring this fascinating field. I'm thrilled to think about the next decade! One project that really gets my creative juices flowing is a virtual reality museum exhibition that utilizes blockchain technology to securely preserve and display exclusive, NFT-based art pieces. Imagine an immersive experience where visitors can explore stunning digital exhibits, purchase and own unique pieces of art, while supporting emerging artists and charities. I envision working alongside a talented team of developers, designers, and artists to bring this innovative concept to life. It's a thrilling prospect to create something that marries technology, art, and social responsibility in a revolutionary way!
