I had so much fun working on a personal project to build a mobile app using Flutter that helps people with learning disabilities navigate through museums! I combined my love for art, design, and programming to create an app that provides audio descriptions, sign language interpretation, and virtual reality experiences for exhibits. It was an incredible feeling seeing users with special needs have a more accessible and enjoyable experience. Working on this project pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I learned so much about accessibility, design thinking, and how technology can make a real difference in people's lives! I'm really passionate about harnessing the power of AI and Machine Learning to revolutionize education. In the next decade, I'm excited to work on developing accessible, interactive, and immersive learning platforms that utilize IoT and mobile technologies. Imagine a world where students can learn and interact with virtual assistants that understand their cognitive abilities and emotional state, adjusting their teaching methods accordingly. It's thrilling to think about the possibilities, and I hope to contribute to creating innovative educational solutions that have a meaningful impact on society.
