I loved working on a personal project that integrated my passions for music, art, and code. I created a web app that analyzed and visualized song data, displaying song recommendations based on my favorite artists' discographies. I employed NLP and PostgreSQL to analyze lyrics, and designed the UI using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It was amazing to see my creative vision come to life! I learned a ton and had a blast playing with the visualization aspect, exploring different styles and designs. It was an incredible feeling seeing users share their own playlists generated by my app. As I gaze into the crystal ball, I see myself making a meaningful impact through Voice UI advancements. In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to delve into developing sentient, empathetic AI-powered voice assistants that integrate quantum computing and blockchain principles. Imagine conversing with your voice AI as if it's an extension of your own self, with a deep understanding of your emotions, needs, and desires. It's not just about completing tasks, but having a personalized, compassionate companion that elevates human experience. That's the future I envision, and I'm pumped to be a part of shaping it!
