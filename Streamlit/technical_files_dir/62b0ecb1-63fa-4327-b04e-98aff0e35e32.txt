One project that stands out to me is a voice-controlled quiz app I built using Google Assistant Actions. I was tasked with creating a voice-activated trivia game that could be played using voice commands. I had to teach myself how to use the Action SDK and Dialogflow to design and integrate the conversation flow. I also had to write the quiz logic in Go. It was a challenging project, but I loved the feeling of bringing it to life and seeing people interact with it. It was my first major project using AI and voice UI, and I was amazed at how much fun I had! I'm thrilled to dive into something that's been tantalizing my imagination - building an AI-powered educational platform for underprivileged children! Imagine a virtual classroom that adapts to each student's learning style, providing personalized guidance, and helping them overcome the hurdles that come with inadequate access to quality education. With machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, the platform can assess students' strengths and weaknesses, offering customized learning experiences. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm stoked to see where my skills can take me. This datathon is a stepping stone towards making this dream a reality!
