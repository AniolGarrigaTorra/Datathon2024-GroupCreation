I had a blast working on a personal project where I built a password manager using React Native and SQL! I've always been obsessed with the importance of strong passwords, and I wanted to create something that made it easy and fun for users to generate and manage complex passwords. I enjoyed designing the interface and implementing the password generation algorithm using React Native, and then connecting it to a SQL database to store and retrieve user data. It was a great challenge for me to tackle a bigger project on my own, and I learned so much along the way! I'm thrilled about the prospect of contributing to the development of secure, decentralized online platforms that prioritize data ownership and privacy. In the next 10 years, I envision a future where blockchain technology has transformed the way we interact with each other and access information online. My dream is to be part of a team that creates a decentralized social media platform, where users have full control over their digital identities and can transact with transparency and trust. I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of decentralized architecture and see my visions become a reality.
