I recently worked on a personal project where I built a simple chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to help my friends manage their gaming teams. It was really enjoyable as it combined my interests in gaming and ML/AI. I wrote a custom algorithm to understand gaming terminology and create a conversational interface for teams to manage rosters, assign roles, and track performance. The best part was seeing my friends use it and receiving feedback on how it improved their teamwork. It was a great exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to a practical problem! I'm thrilled to think about the potential projects that are on the horizon! In the next 10 years, I'm ecstatic about the prospect of working on AI-powered retail platforms that use machine learning to optimize inventory management, personalized product recommendations, and seamless checkout experiences for customers. I envision using natural language processing to enable voice-controlled customer service and IoT sensors to monitor inventory levels in real-time. My goal is to revolutionize the retail industry by creating an immersive and personalized shopping experience that bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
