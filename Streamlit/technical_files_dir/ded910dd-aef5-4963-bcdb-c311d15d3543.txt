I'd say one of my favorite projects was when I created a simple iOS app that used AR to visualize 3D models of museum exhibits. I learned a lot about sceneKit and CoreML, and it was really cool to see my app bring exhibits to life. I also got to work with a group of historians and museum curators to understand their needs and create an app that was both educational and engaging. It was a great chance to blend my love of programming with my interest in design and social good. What a great question! As a futurist at heart, I'm thrilled to think about the kind of impact I can make in the next decade. My ultimate goal is to revolutionize healthcare using advanced technologies like AR/VR, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT). I envision developing innovative solutions that enable remote, personalized, and effective healthcare experiences for patients worldwide. Imagine a world where chronic disease management becomes a thing of the past, thanks to data-driven insights and intuitive, voice-controlled interfaces. That's the vision I'm working towards, and I'm pumped to be a part of this datathon community to bring it one step closer to reality!
