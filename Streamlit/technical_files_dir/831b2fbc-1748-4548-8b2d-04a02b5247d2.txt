One project that I really enjoyed was a mobile app I developed during my iOS development course. It was a personalized habit tracker that helped users stay on top of their daily routines. I loved the combination of design and programming that went into creating the app. I designed the UI/UX, wrote the code, and even added a dash of AI-powered suggestions based on the user's habits. Seeing my idea come to life and receiving feedback from friends who used it made it a truly rewarding experience. It's a great feeling knowing that I can turn a concept into something real! I'm stoked to dive into a project that combines my passions for education and fintech. Within the next decade, I envision developing an AI-powered platform that helps underserved communities access affordable financial services and resources. By integrating natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, my platform would utilize voice recognition to empower individuals with literacy skills to manage their finances, access education, and build financial stability. It's a challenging and exciting goal, but I believe that innovative data analysis and solutions can bridge the gap and bring tangible improvements to people's lives.
