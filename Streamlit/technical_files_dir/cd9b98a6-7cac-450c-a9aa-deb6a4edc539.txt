I had a blast working on a personal project to develop a chatbot using Rust and TypeScript! I'd always been fascinated by natural language processing, so I decided to build a bot that could help users manage their expenses by categorizing transactions and providing insightful recommendations. It was a great opportunity to learn about machine learning and NLP, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment when it finally came together. I also loved the flexibility to tweak and iterate on the project, making it a truly engaging experience. It's a project I'm proud to have showcased, and I'm excited to see where it takes me! As I gaze into the crystal ball, I'm thrilled to think about what's to come. In the next decade, I'm excited to work on developing autonomous vehicles that have the potential to revolutionize transportation and urban planning. As a computer science enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by AI and its applications. With my programming skills in Rust and TypeScript, I aim to contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems that not only improve road safety but also reduce traffic congestion and emissions. The possibilities are endless, and I can barely contain my excitement thinking about the innovations that await us!
