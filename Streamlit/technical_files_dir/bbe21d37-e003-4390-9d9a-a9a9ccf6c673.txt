One of my favorite projects was creating a habit tracker mobile app using Python and PostgreSQL. As someone who's trying to stay on top of my daily routines, I realized that there wasn't a simple app that fit my needs, so I decided to make one myself! It was a fun and rewarding experience to learn more about UI/UX design and how to create a seamless user experience. Plus, it's been a huge help in staying consistent with my goals. What an exciting thought! In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to contribute to developing personalized, accessible education platforms that revolutionize the way we learn. Imagine a world where AI-powered adaptive curricula ensure every individual achieves their full potential, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. As someone with a passion for Education and Databases, I envision creating a platform that not only leverages machine learning algorithms but also incorporates innovative mobile experiences, virtual reality, and Blockchain technologies to create a seamless, empowering learning ecosystem. It's a challenge I'm eager to tackle, and the datathon will be a crucial stepping stone in making this vision a reality.
