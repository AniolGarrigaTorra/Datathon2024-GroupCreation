I had a blast working on a project called CyberShelter in one of my college courses. It was a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project where we had to design and develop an automated system to help small businesses protect themselves from cyber attacks. We built a UI using Flutter and used RPA tools to automate tasks such as data encryption, anomaly detection, and report generation. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect and working with my team to brainstorm innovative solutions. It was an excellent learning experience, and I'm glad I could apply my skills to something practical and meaningful! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the idea of building an autonomous security system that can proactively identify and mitigate threats in the financial sector. In the next 10 years, I hope to contribute to the development of such a system, leveraging my skills in blockchain and cybersecurity to create a robust, AI-driven framework. Imagine a futuristic security apparatus that detects and responds to suspicious activities in real-time, giving institutions a strong defense against financial crimes. It's a challenging but thrilling goal, and I'm excited to take on the challenge with like-minded individuals at the datathon!
