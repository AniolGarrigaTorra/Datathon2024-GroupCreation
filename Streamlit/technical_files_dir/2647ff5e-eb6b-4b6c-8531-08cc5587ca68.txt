I had a blast working on a mobile game project during my university's hackathon. It was a turn-based puzzle game where players collect virtual pets. I was responsible for building the game's backend using Node.js and MongoDB. I also implemented some basic machine learning algorithms using PyTorch to make the pets evolve as players progressed through the game. The game was a huge success, and it was amazing to see players engaging with our creation. I loved the entire experience, from designing the game mechanics to pitching it to potential investors. It was an incredible feeling seeing our project come to life! I'm super stoked to say that I'm dreaming big about developing an AI-powered virtual reality platform that helps people with disabilities navigate their surroundings more independently. I believe that technology has the power to bridge the gaps in our world, and I'm fascinated by the idea of combining AI, VR, and sensory integration to create a seamless, empowering experience. I'm envisioning a future where my platform assists individuals with visual impairments, Parkinson's disease, or cognitive impairments to confidently explore and interact with the world around them. It's a lofty goal, but I'm excited to start building the foundation for it!
