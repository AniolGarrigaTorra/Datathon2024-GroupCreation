I'm really passionate about a music recommendation system I built with my friends last year! We used IoT to collect music data from Spotify playlists, then implemented a computer vision component to analyze the images posted on social media with song lyrics. Our app suggested music based on the user's listening habits and the lyrics' sentiment. It was awesome to combine my love for music and coding into one project! We even held a small concert where we tested it out with friends and families, and it was amazing to see people jamming out to personalized playlists! What an incredible question! As a 21-year-old with a passion for technology and innovation, I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities in the next decade. In my wildest dreams, I envision working on a cutting-edge AI-powered wearable device that monitors patients' health conditions and adapts to their needs. Imagine a device that integrates data from wearable sensors, electronic health records, and environmental factors to provide personalized health advice. This wearable device would enable remote health monitoring, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. I'm excited to be part of a team that brings this technology to reality!
