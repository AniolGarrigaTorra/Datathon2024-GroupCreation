One of my favorite projects was a smart home automation system I built for my mom, a person with disabilities. Using Python, Flask, and Figma, I created an intuitive UI that integrated with various sensors and devices around her home. I wrote scripts to manage lighting, temperature, and security cameras remotely. It was rewarding to see my mom's face light up when I demoed the system and explained how it made her life easier. This project wasn't about winning or gaining recognition; it was about creating something that brought value and independence to someone I care about. The future is bright! In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to embark on a project that combines my passions for AI, education, and social impact. I envision developing an AI-powered, gamified platform that uses personalized learning algorithms to improve student outcomes in underprivileged schools worldwide. This platform would leverage natural language processing to generate adaptive learning materials, machine learning to track student progress, and blockchain to ensure data security. The goal is to make quality education more accessible and effective, empowering students to change their own destinies and create positive change in their communities.
