I recently worked on a technical project, building a chatbot for a small e-commerce website using PyTorch and React. I designed the chatbot to assist customers with basic queries like product recommendations and order tracking. It was a great opportunity to integrate multiple technologies I'm passionate about, like AI, web development, and data visualization. What I enjoyed most was seeing the chatbot come to life, and testing it with friends and family to gather feedback. It was a great feeling to watch users interact with my creation, and it made me realize the potential of combining my tech interests in innovative ways. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities in the next 10 years! What I'm most excited about is working on AI-powered sustainable infrastructure. I envision developing intelligent systems that can help cities and industries reduce their carbon footprint, predict and prevent natural disasters, and optimize resource allocation. Imagine a future where buildings, roads, and cities are designed with AI-driven sustainability in mind. I'd love to work on projects that marry my passions for ML/AI, DevOps, and IoT to make a tangible impact on the environment and human lives.
