I recently worked on a personal project where I built a simple voice assistant using PyTorch and Flutter. I've always been fascinated by AI and the potential to integrate it with mobile apps. My project, Echo, allows users to control their phone with voice commands. I had a lot of fun experimenting with different intents, context detection, and sentiment analysis. Although it's still a work in progress, I enjoyed the challenge of learning about natural language processing and integrating it with my mobile development skills. It was a great exercise in creativity and problem-solving! I'm really passionate about developing innovative applications that harness the power of AI and machine learning. In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on a project that integrates natural language processing and computer vision to create an AI-powered language learning platform that enables people from diverse backgrounds to effectively communicate with one another. This platform would utilize voice recognition, AR, and social media to simulate real-life conversations, making language acquisition more engaging and accessible. I believe this project has the potential to make a significant impact on bridging cultural gaps and fostering global understanding.
