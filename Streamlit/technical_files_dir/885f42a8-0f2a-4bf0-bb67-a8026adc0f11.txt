One project I'm really proud of is a mobile app I built in Flutter to manage my favorite bands' tours. As an avid music fan, I always wanted a convenient way to track upcoming concerts and set reminders. So, I created an app that allows users to add their favorite bands, view their tour schedules, and receive push notifications when tickets go on sale. It was a great learning experience for me, and I'm thrilled with how it turned out. Plus, it's been a lifesaver for planning my music festival outings! As a 18-year-old student with a passion for blockchain and innovation, I'm excited to work on revolutionizing the music industry through decentralized, artist-friendly platforms. Imagine a world where artists can tokenize their music and retain creative control, while also fostering a community that rewards fans for curating and sharing their favorite tracks. This technology has the potential to disrupt the status quo, enabling creators to connect directly with their audiences and bypass traditional industry gatekeepers. I dream of building a decentralized music empire that empowers artists to thrive and puts the focus back on the music.
