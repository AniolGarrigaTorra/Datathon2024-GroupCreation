I really enjoyed working on a project to design a augmented reality mobile app for tracking one's daily habits and mental health. I'm really into the idea of combining tech with wellness, and I love AR, so it was a dream project for me. We designed the app to visualize habits and emotions, providing users with personalized insights and recommendations for improvement. I got to work on the UI design, implementing AR features using ARKit, and it was amazing to see it come together! As a huge fan of fintech and its potential to revolutionize the way we manage our financial lives, I'm super excited to work on developing innovative mobile banking solutions that utilize AR/VR technology. Imagine walking into a physical bank branch and being greeted by an augmented reality teller, offering you personalized financial advice and account updates in real-time. Or, accessing your bank account through a virtual reality interface, effortlessly making payments and managing your finances in an immersive, intuitive environment. I believe this kind of technology could vastly improve financial literacy and accessibility, making banking more accessible and fun!
