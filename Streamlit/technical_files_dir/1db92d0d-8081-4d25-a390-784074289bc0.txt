I had so much fun working on a project with my squad to create a VR escape room for a local children's hospital. We used Unity to develop the game, designing puzzles and challenges that were both engaging and educational. As a design enthusiast, I was stoked to see our creation bring joy to the kids and parents during their hospital stay. The tech skills I employed were React, which we used to develop the interface, and Figma, for design prototyping. Seeing the impact it had on the community made all the late-night coding sessions worth it! I'm thrilled to dive into the future! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to work on developing innovative, AI-powered cybersecurity solutions that seamlessly integrate Blockchain technology. Imagine a world where sensitive data is safeguarded using smart contracts, and artificial intelligence predicts and prevents cyber threats in real-time. It's a complex problem, but I believe my passion for Cybersecurity, coding skills in React, and interest in Blockchain can drive meaningful progress. If I can be part of this revolution, shaping the future of online protection and trust, I'll feel like I've truly made a significant impact.
