I recently worked on a personal project that I'm really passionate about - a React Native app for gamers. I was obsessed with finding a way to track my game stats and connect with other players. I designed the UI/UX from scratch and used my intermediate JavaScript skills to build it. I also experimented with blockchain to create a secure way to store and sync user data across devices. It was an incredible learning experience and a ton of fun. Seeing my app come together and working on the problem-solving aspect was super rewarding. I can't wait to dive into more projects like this! I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastically following developments in the realm of Edge AI and its applications in smart cities. In the next decade, I envision a future where autonomous vehicles navigate our streets seamlessly, leveraging computer vision and edge computing to detect and respond to the world around them. Moreover, the fusion of IoT devices with blockchain technology will enable unprecedented scalability, security, and transparency in various industries, revolutionizing the way we live and interact with each other. The prospect of contributing to this evolution excites me, and I look forward to the opportunity to push the boundaries of innovation at the datathon.
