I loved working on a personal project where I designed and built an AR-powered art studio app for iOS and Android. Using TensorFlow for object detection and computer vision, I enabled users to scan their surroundings, identify objects, and manipulate them virtually. The app used ARKit and ARCore to bring these digital objects to life. It was an incredible feeling to see my art come to life in 3D! As someone who loves design and gaming, this project combined my passions and pushed me to learn new tech. I had so much fun bringing it to life and exploring its possibilities. I'm thrilled to think about the future, and in the next decade, I'd love to delve into the world of Augmented Reality and its applications in the finance sector. With my passion for fintech and programming, I envision creating an AR-driven platform that enables users to manage their finances more effectively and interact with their money in a more immersive and gamified way. Imagine being able to virtually try on financial concepts, make data-driven decisions, and track your progress in a visually stunning environment. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to take the first step in bringing this innovative concept to life.
