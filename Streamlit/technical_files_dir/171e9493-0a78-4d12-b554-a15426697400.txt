I recently built a simple AR game using Figma and Android Development. It was so much fun to see my game come to life! I designed the game's interface and characters in Figma, and then coded the gameplay mechanics using Java. I loved experimenting with different animations and effects to create a whimsical atmosphere. It was a great learning experience, and I'm so proud of what I accomplished. Who knows, maybe one day I'll release it to the public and share it with my friends! What a thrilling question! I'm absolutely stoked to share my dream project with you. In the next decade, I'm excited to contribute to the development of a cutting-edge, wearable AI-powered exosuit for people with disabilities. I envision this technology revolutionizing the way individuals with mobility or communication impairments interact with the world. By integrating AI-powered voice commands, motion sensing, and gesture recognition, I believe we can empower people to participate more fully in society, achieve greater independence, and push beyond their perceived limitations. This project ignites my passion for human-centered design and drives me to continue pursuing innovation.
