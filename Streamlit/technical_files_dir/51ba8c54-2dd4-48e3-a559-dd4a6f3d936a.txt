I had a blast working on a project that combined my passions for IoT and healthcare! I developed an Android app that used machine learning to track and alert patients with chronic conditions to take their medication on time. I used Python for data analysis and built a simple dashboard with Flask to visualize patient data. It was amazing to see my code come to life and potentially make a positive impact on people's lives. The experience also honed my skills in data analysis and mobile development, which was a fantastic bonus! I'm thrilled to dive into something that truly gets my heart racing - the fusion of wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and mental health monitoring. I envision creating a cutting-edge smart wearable device that detects early signs of anxiety and depression through subtle biometric changes, providing personalized recommendations and AI-driven therapy sessions. Imagine having a companion that not only tracks your physical health but also offers compassionate support, empowering individuals to prioritize their mental wellbeing and foster a sense of community. The prospect of making a tangible impact on people's lives is what drives me and fuels my passion.
