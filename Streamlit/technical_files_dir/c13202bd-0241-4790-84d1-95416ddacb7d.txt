I absolutely loved working on a project where I built a web scraper using Python and Flask to collect data on music festivals' lineups and ticket prices. I'd always been passionate about music, and seeing how the data visualization turned out was a thrill! I used PyTorch to create a predictive model to forecast ticket prices, which gave me a glimpse into the world of machine learning. The best part was seeing the project come to life and feeling proud of the end result. It was a blast exploring new tech and making something that'd be useful to fellow festival-goers! What a thrilling thought! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to delve into the realm of AI-powered educational platforms. I'm passionate about how technology can transform the way we learn and develop skills. Imagine a world where interactive, immersive, and adaptive learning experiences are accessible to everyone, everywhere. I dream of creating a platform that utilizes natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to create personalized lesson plans, gamify learning, and offer real-time feedback. This ambitious goal motivates me to hone my skills in PyTorch, Docker, and Flask, and to stay atop the AI/ML waves.
