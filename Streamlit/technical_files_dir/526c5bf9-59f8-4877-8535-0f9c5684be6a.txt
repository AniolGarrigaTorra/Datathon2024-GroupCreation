One project that really stands out to me was a Python-based project I worked on for a computer vision course in school. We were tasked with building an object detection system using OpenCV and machine learning. I loved the process of collecting and labeling a dataset, training the model, and seeing it come to life as it started to detect objects correctly. It was a fun and challenging project that let me explore the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. I even got to add some IoT flair by integrating it with an ESP32 microcontroller! I'm really passionate about using technology to bridge communication gaps, particularly in the elderly and accessibility space. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing intelligent voice assistants that can seamlessly integrate with assistive technology, enabling people with disabilities to communicate more efficiently and independently. I envision an AI-powered companion that can recognize emotions, adapt to personal needs, and provide real-time language translation - essentially, a language and cognitive barrier-breaker. This kind of innovation could vastly improve the quality of life for individuals with limited mobility or cognitive impairments.
