One of my favorite projects was when I built a social learning platform for students called ConnectEd. I designed a web application using React Native and integrated a chatbot using TensorFlow to help students find study groups and connect with peers. I also used a MongoDB database to store user information and conversation history. It was a thrilling project as it combined my interests in education and web development. Seeing users engaged and forming friendships through the platform made it all worthwhile. It was an amazing feeling, and I'd love to continue working on it! I'm excited to work on revolutionizing education through AI-powered personalized learning experiences. With the vast amount of data available, I envision creating a platform that utilizes machine learning to adapt learning materials to each individual's needs, style, and pace. By leveraging AR and VR technologies, I want to make learning more engaging, interactive, and accessible to students worldwide. I envision a future where education is democratized, and every student has equal access to high-quality learning resources, regardless of their geographical location or socio-economic background. It's a lofty goal, but I'm passionate about making a positive impact on education.
