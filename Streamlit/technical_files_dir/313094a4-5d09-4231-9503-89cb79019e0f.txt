I worked on a personal project using Arduino and Raspberry Pi to build a smart home automation system. I loved experimenting with sensors and actuators to create a voice-controlled interface using Alexa Skill Kit. It was amazing to see my project come to life, and I was proud to automate tasks like lighting and temperature control. The project taught me about IoT, machine learning, and integration with Amazon's services. It was a unique blend of programming, electronics, and design, and I enjoyed seeing how it all fit together. I'm thrilled to think about what lies ahead! In the next decade, I envision myself making a tangible impact in the field of education through data-driven innovations. I'd love to develop AI-powered platforms that integrate IoT sensors and voice assistants to provide personalized learning experiences for students with special needs. By leveraging blockchain and RPA, I aim to create a seamless, secure, and efficient system for educational data management and accessibility. My dream is to revolutionize the way we approach education, ensuring that every individual has access to equitable opportunities and is empowered to reach their full potential.
