I had an absolute blast working on a music recommendation system using computer vision and machine learning. I wrote a script in Python to analyze the color palette and geometric patterns in album covers, then used this data to train a model to suggest similar music. It was amazing to see how effective it was! I built a GUI using Flutter and even implemented a simple backend with a SQL database. The project allowed me to merge my passion for music and art with my programming skills. It was a fun challenge that taught me a lot about how to approach complex projects. As a tech enthusiast, I'm thrilled to envision a future where Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality merge to revolutionize healthcare. I aspire to develop an AR-powered diagnostic tool, trained on massive health data, that enables remote examination and personalized treatment plans. This technology would democratize access to quality healthcare, especially in underserved communities. The prospect of combining my interests in AI, computer vision, and AR excites me greatly. With dedication and innovation, I'm confident that my vision can become a reality, and I'm eager to take the first steps towards making it a tangible achievement.
