I recently worked on a project where I built a simple machine learning model using PyTorch to predict patient outcomes for people with Parkinson's disease. I was really inspired by the potential for tech to make a real difference in people's lives. It was my first time using PyTorch, and I loved the flexibility and ease of use. I also got to work with a dataset that included physical activity and cognitive assessments, which I found really interesting. Even though it was a small project, I learned a lot and got a sense of satisfaction from seeing my code come together to solve a meaningful problem. I'm thrilled to think about the potential impact we can make with technology. In the next 10 years, I envision working on developing AI-powered platforms that can address pressing global issues, such as equitable access to quality healthcare and education. I dream of creating tools that utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict health patterns, enabling personalized treatment plans and remote consultations. Additionally, I'd love to collaborate on initiatives that use IoT technology to monitor and mitigate the effects of climate change. The thought of empowering marginalized communities with data-driven solutions excites me beyond words!
