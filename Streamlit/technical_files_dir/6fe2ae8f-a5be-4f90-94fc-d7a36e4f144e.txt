I had a blast working on a school project where I built a smart garden using IoT and React Native. I set up a sensor to monitor soil moisture and created an app to receive notifications when it needed watering. I designed the UI/UX to be super user-friendly, and it was amazing to see my project come to life. What I loved most was experimenting with different sensors and coding in TypeScript to make it all work together. It was a great hands-on experience that combined my passions for programming, design, and environmental sustainability! What an exciting question! Over the next decade, I'm eagerly looking forward to developing artificial intelligence-driven systems that have a direct impact on society's most pressing issues. Specifically, I'm fascinated by the potential of Robotic Process Automation to revolutionize healthcare, education, and accessibility. Imagine AI-powered chatbots assisting elderly or disabled individuals with daily tasks, while also helping medical professionals streamline their workflow to focus on more high-priority cases. The prospect of leveraging my technical skills to create tangible social good keeps me energized and motivated to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible!
