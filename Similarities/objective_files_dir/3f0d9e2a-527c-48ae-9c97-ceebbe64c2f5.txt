My objective for this datathon is straightforward: I'm here to compete and crush it. I've got a hunger to win, and I'm willing to put in the effort to get there. I'm not here to make friends (although, who knows, I might actually make some awesome connections) - I'm here to prove to myself that I can take on a tough challenge and come out on top. Bring on the data, and let's see what I'm made of! Hey there! I'm Alexis Rivero, a driven 18-year-old student. I've just started my first year of studies and I'm excited to take on the world - or at least, crush the datathon! I'm all about learning new skills and taking on challenges, and this competition is the perfect opportunity to do so. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of technology to make a positive impact. Bring on the data and get ready for a battle-hardened student looking to prove herself!
