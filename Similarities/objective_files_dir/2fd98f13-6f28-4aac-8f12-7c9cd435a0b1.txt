My goal is to bring home that coveted first prize. I'm going all in, folks! I'll be diving headfirst into the challenge, sacrificing sleep and social lives (just kidding... sort of) to crack open that toughest problem set. My skills may not be top-notch, but I'm eager to prove myself and push my limits. I'll be laser-focused on the tasks at hand, staying up-to-date on the latest tools and technologies, and networking like crazy to find the perfect teammate. It's time to bring that datathon trophy to my shelf - and I'm not leaving until I get it! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a 20-year-old student with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. I'm all about maximizing my productivity and staying ahead of the curve. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, where I'm hoping to push my limits and learn as much as I can. I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to serious coding competitions, but I'm ready to dive in and see what I can accomplish. Wish me luck - I'm going for that top prize!
