Hey! My objective for this datathon is to absorb as much as I can from this immersive experience. As a beginner programmer, I'm eager to dive deeper into data analysis and machine learning concepts. I want to spend my time learning new techniques, familiarizing myself with different tools and languages, and practicing problem-solving skills. I'm not too worried about winning; my priority is to improve my skills, expand my knowledge, and set a solid foundation for future projects. Bring on the challenges - I'm excited to level up my skills! Hi! I'm Elara Moncada, a 19-year-old student with a passion for learning.
