For me, it's all about growth and development. I'm looking to push my programming skills to the next level and expand my knowledge in areas I'm not too familiar with. I want to take advantage of the resources and expertise available during the datathon to improve my coding chops and get feedback from experienced mentors. My objective is to tackle complex challenges, learn from mistakes, and come out of this event feeling more confident and prepared to tackle real-world projects. Bring on the coding challenges! Hey there! I'm Emily, a 20-year-old third-year student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I've been working with Python and PyTorch, and I'm eager to apply my skills to tackle new challenges. As a tech enthusiast, I'm intrigued by the possibilities of Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning/AI. With the datathon, I'm hoping to push my programming boundaries, learn from others, and gain confidence in tackling real-world projects. I'm all about growth and development, and I'm excited to be a part of this adventure!
