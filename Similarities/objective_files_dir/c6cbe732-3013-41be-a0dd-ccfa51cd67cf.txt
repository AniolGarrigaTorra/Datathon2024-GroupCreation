My objective for this datathon is to have a blast and soak up all the exciting experiences! As a 2nd-year student, I'm looking forward to diving into the events, learning from my fellow participants, and making new friends who share my passion for data. I don't plan on stressing too much about winning - let's just say, I'm a laid-back competitor. My aim is to attend as many workshops, ignite talks, and meetups as possible, and I'm stoked to be surrounded by like-minded people. Let's make this datathon an unforgettable adventure! Hey there! I'm SÃ²nia, a 19-year-old undergrad student with a passion for data and technology. I've dived into programming and am loving every minute of it! My biggest interest lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, Fintech, and E-commerce. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me exploring Quantum computing or experimenting with design on Figma. This datathon is all about embracing the fun and learning experience - I'm super excited to meet fellow data enthusiasts and share our collective excitement! Let's ride this wave of data exploration together!
