My objective for this datathon is clear-cut: I'm here to crush it and come out on top! I've got a fierce competitive streak and I'm always pushing myself to be better. I've participated in four hackathons already and each time I've walked away with something valuable, but this time I'm determined to take it to the next level. I want to push my skills to the limit, think outside the box, and produce something innovative and impressive. I'm ready to put in the long hours, sweat, and tears to make this happen - watch out, I'm coming for that top spot! Hey everyone! I'm Emily May Winston, a 20-year-old student with a passion for making a difference through code. I've got a competitive streak and love the thrill of the chase, especially in hackathons. So far, I've tackled four hackathons and each time, I've walked away with something new to take away. This time, I'm aiming to push my limits and create something innovative and impressive. I'm all about blending art and tech, creating something beautiful and functional. Bring it on, and let's crush this datathon!
