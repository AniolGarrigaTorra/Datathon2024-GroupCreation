My main objective for this datathon is to dive into something new and challenging while continuously improving my skills. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I always felt like I could have done more to really master certain topics. This datathon presents an opportunity for me to focus on expanding my knowledge and abilities. I'm excited to tackle projects that push me out of my comfort zone and learn from experienced mentors and peers. I hope to leave this event with a renewed sense of confidence in my skills and a fresh perspective on tackling complex problems. Hey there! I'm Evelyn, a 21-year-old student diving into my third year of uni. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkering with code or experimenting with design. I've had a taste of hackathons before, but I always left feeling there was more to explore. This datathon is all about pushing my limits and sharpening my skills. I'm stoked to be surrounded by like-minded folks who share my passion for innovation and problem-solving. I'm ready to challenge myself and take on new projects that'll leave me feeling pumped and motivated. See you around!
