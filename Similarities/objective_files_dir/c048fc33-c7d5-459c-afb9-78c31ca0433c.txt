Hey, I'm Astrid! My goal for this datathon is to soak up the energy and have an amazing time with fellow data enthusiasts. I'm looking forward to attending tons of events, workshops, and activities, meeting new people, and making friends. I'm not super competitive and I'd rather spend my time exploring new topics, learning from others, and sharing my own experiences. I want to return home with a smile on my face, feeling inspired and connected with the community. Let's have fun and learn together! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a fourth-year student with a passion for exploring the latest tech trends. I love creating innovative solutions and combining art with tech to make it visually stunning. When I'm not coding away, you can find me jamming to indie music or attempting to tackle my latest art project. At this datathon, I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals, attend engaging sessions, and soak up as much knowledge as possible. My aim is to leave with a newfound sense of inspiration and a stronger connection to the community - and maybe a few new friends along the way!
