Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to chill, have fun, and make some new friends. I'm not all about winning or trying to be the best - I just want to enjoy the experience and meet like-minded people. I'm down for trying out new skills, learning from others, and participating in all the fun events and activities. I'm all about the vibes, dude! Hey there! I'm Aurora Reyes, a 22-year-old student soaking up knowledge in my fourth year. When I'm not hitting the books, I love jamming out to tunes and sketching artful masterpieces. For this datathon, I'm all about chill vibes and making new friends. I'm not competing against anyone; I just want to explore new tech skills, learn from others, and enjoy the fun activities. I'm stoked to meet fellow enthusiasts and exchange ideas. Let's vibe and see where the experience takes us!
