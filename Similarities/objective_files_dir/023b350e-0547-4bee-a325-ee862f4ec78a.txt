Hey! My objective for this datathon is to come out on top - I'm here to win! With my programming skills and experience from previous hackathons (I've participated in 7 so far), I'm confident in my abilities to tackle the challenges ahead. My goal is to dominate the competition and take home that top prize. I'm ready to put in the long hours, collaborate with my teammates, and push myself to the limit to emerge victorious. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Maria Francesca, a third-year student with a passion for programming and a competitive streak. I've had experience in hackathons, so I'm used to tackling tough challenges and collaborating with my teammates. My goal for this datathon is to win, and I'm confident that my skills and experience will help me achieve it. Outside of programming, I'm all about staying productive and organized, and I love gaming in my free time. I'm excited to be here, meet new people, and take on the datathon challenges head-on!
