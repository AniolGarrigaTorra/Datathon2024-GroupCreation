My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm all about having a blast and meeting new people! I've done a few hackathons before, and while I learned a ton, I really got burned out on the competitive aspect. This time, I'm here to hang out, learn some new stuff, and participate in as many events as I can. I'd love to make some new friends who share my passion for tech and Data Science. Let's grab lunch, play some coding games, or attend a workshop together! Hey there! I'm CÃ©line, an 18-year-old student looking forward to making some unforgettable memories at this datathon. With a passion for tech and a knack for design, I'm excited to learn from others and share my own experiences. I've had a taste of hackathons before, but this time, I'm here to focus on having fun and making friends. I'm a bit of a curious cat, always looking to level up my skills and knowledge. When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me playing games, listening to music, or watching sci-fi movies. Looking forward to meeting you all!
