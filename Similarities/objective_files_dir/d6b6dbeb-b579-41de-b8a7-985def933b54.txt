I'm in this datathon to come out on top - plain and simple! I'm a competitive person by nature, and I thrive under pressure. I've participated in three hackathons already and I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. My goal is to stay focused, push myself to the limit, and deliver an outstanding project that impresses the judges. I'm willing to put in the extra effort, work tirelessly, and do whatever it takes to stand out and take the win. Let's get down to business and see if I can bring home the gold! Hey, I'm Ana-Katharina Ferrer, a 20-year-old student and coding enthusiast. I'm all about pushing myself to be the best I can be, which is why I'm here for the datathon. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I'm ready to take it to the next level. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or working on new designs for my own gaming project. I love the thrill of competition and the rush of creativity when faced with a new challenge. Bring on the Datathon, and let's see what I'm capable of!
