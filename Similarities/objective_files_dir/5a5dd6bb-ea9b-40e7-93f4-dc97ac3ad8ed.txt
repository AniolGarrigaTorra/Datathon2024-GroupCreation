My objective for this datathon is to use the challenge as an opportunity to level up my skills and knowledge. I'm in my fourth year of uni, and I've participated in five hackathons already, but I'm eager to dig deeper into the latest tech trends and approaches. I want to take on new projects, experiment with different tools and languages, and learn from the expert mentors and peers here. Ultimately, I'm hoping to return to my studies with fresh ideas and perspectives, and maybe even develop some new hobbies or interests. Hey there!
