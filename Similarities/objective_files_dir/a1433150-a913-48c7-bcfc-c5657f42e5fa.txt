Hey there! As Alba English Espinacelles, my objective for this datathon is to make the most of this incredible experience and soak up all the fun! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, making lifelong connections, and getting involved in as many events and activities as possible. I want to learn from others, share my own knowledge, and create unforgettable memories. Sure, I'll do my best, but I'm not too fussed about winning - it's about having an amazing time and building an awesome network. Let's make this datathon one to remember! Hey! I'm Alba, a 22-year-old coding enthusiast studying my fourth year. When I'm not buried in books, you can find me exploring new music, art, and all things creative. My passion for social impact drives me to seek out projects that make a difference. With some IoT and Android development skills under my belt, I'm excited to dive into the datathon's challenges. I'm more about connection than competition, so let's create some unforgettable memories! If you're looking for someone to geek out with or share some inspiration, I'm your gal.
