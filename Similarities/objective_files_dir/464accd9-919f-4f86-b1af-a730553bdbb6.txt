As a coding newbie, I'm super excited to dive into the datathon and learn as much as I can. My objective is to take away some tangible skills and knowledge that I can apply to my studies and future projects. I'm eager to tackle new challenges, work with others, and figure out how to implement data insights. I don't expect to win, but I do hope to get out of here with some solid programming skills and a network of fellow coding enthusiasts. Let's do this and grow together! Hey! I'm Sof√≠a, a 17-year-old student eager to dive into the world of coding. As a beginner, I'm excited to learn new skills and take away tangible knowledge from this datathon. I've always been fascinated by how technology can be applied to real-life problems, whether it's through lifehacks or innovative solutions.
