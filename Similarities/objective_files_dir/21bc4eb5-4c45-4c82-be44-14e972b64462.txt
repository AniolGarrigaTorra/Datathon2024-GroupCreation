Hey, it's Ava here! I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon! My goal for this event is to have an amazing time making new friends and having fun. I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and learn from everyone around me. I'm not too concerned about winning, but I do want to give it my all and participate in as many events as I can. I hope to network with like-minded people, attend some awesome workshops, and walk away with some fantastic memories. Hey! I'm Ava Winchester, a second-year student with a passion for coding and all things tech. I've had a solid foundation in programming languages, and I'm excited to learn more and expand my skills. When I'm not buried in my textbooks or coding away, you can find me playing the latest games or trying to figure out the next big thing in innovation. I'm a sucker for lifehacks and finding efficient ways to make my life easier. Above all, I'm all about learning, growing, and having fun. See you around the datathon!
