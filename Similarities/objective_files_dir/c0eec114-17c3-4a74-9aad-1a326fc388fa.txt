My main objective for this datathon is to come out on top! I'm all about giving it my best shot and pushing myself to the limit to take home that top prize. I've participated in a couple of hackathons before and I know what it takes to win. I'm not here to make friends (at least, not until we've got that prize in the bag). My priority is to learn what it takes to make a killer project, work seamlessly with a team, and present our idea in the most compelling way possible. Bring it on, datathon! Hey there! I'm Neus, a 17-year-old student with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I've dabbled in coding and design, and I'm excited to push my skills to the limit in this datathon. My competitive streak is always on high alert, and I'm determined to come out on top. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest fintech trends or bingeing the latest gaming releases. I'm all about learning and improving, and I'm looking forward to working with an amazing team to create something truly amazing. Bring on the challenge!
