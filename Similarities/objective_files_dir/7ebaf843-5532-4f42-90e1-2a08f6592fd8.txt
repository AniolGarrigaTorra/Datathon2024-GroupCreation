Hellllo! So, I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! For me, it's all about vibing with the community, learning from others, and having an absolute blast! I want to attend as many workshops, panels, and activities as I can, soak up new skills and ideas, and make some amazing connections along the way. Win or lose, I just want to enjoy the experience, meet new people, and maybe even find some like-minded friends to collaborate with. Let's do this and have some seriously good times! Hey! I'm Sabina, a 20-year-old student with a passion for innovation and making a positive impact. I've been dabbling in programming for a few years now, and I'm always excited to meet like-minded people who share my enthusiasm. I'm all about creating and solving problems, whether it's through developing new tech or finding ways to use existing tech for social good. I'm looking forward to learning from others, networking, and having an amazing time at the datathon!
