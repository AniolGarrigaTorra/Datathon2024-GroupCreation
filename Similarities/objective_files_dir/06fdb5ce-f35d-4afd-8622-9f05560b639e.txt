Hey there! I'm Pilar, and for this datathon, my objective is to dive headfirst into learning new tech skills and improving my development skills. I've participated in six hackathons already, but I know there's always room for growth, and I'm excited to tackle some challenging projects. I'm looking forward to working with new people and gaining insights from their experiences. My goal is to leave this event with a stronger foundation in data analysis and some fresh ideas for my own projects. Wish me luck, and let's learn together! Hey! I'm Pilar, a third-year student with a passion for all things tech. I've dabbled in programming and participated in six hackathons before, but I'm always looking to level up my skills. I'm particularly fascinated by how tech can intersect with other areas like art and music. I'm excited to dive into data analysis during this datathon, learn from others, and walk away with new ideas and perspectives. Let's jam together and make some amazing projects!
