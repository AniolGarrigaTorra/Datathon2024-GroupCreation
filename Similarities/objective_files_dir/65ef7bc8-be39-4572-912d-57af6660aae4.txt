For this datathon, my goal is to come out with a bang - I want to make new friends, have an absolute blast, and participate in as many events as possible! I'm all about that datathon vibe, you know? I love learning new things and improving my skills, but this time, I'm focusing on experiencing all the behind-the-scenes action, from workshops to meetups to jam sessions. Bring on the datathon camaraderie and memories - I'm ready to have the time of my life! Hey, I'm Alessia! A 20-year-old student diving into my third year, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I'm all about making the most of this experience and having an absolute blast with like-minded people. I'm a bit of a hackathon newbie, but I'm eager to soak up as much as I can - from coding sessions to workshops and meetups. When I'm not stuck on a project, you can find me scouring the web for lifehacks and tips on making my online presence more awesome. Looking forward to meeting you and making some unforgettable memories!
