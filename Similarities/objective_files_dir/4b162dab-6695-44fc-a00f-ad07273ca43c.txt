I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! As a student and coding newbie, I'm more interested in learning and improving my skills than winning. My goal is to soak up as much knowledge as possible, master some new technologies, and maybe even tackle a project I've been wanting to start. I want to walk away from this datathon feeling empowered, inspired, and with some practical takeaways to apply to my studies and future projects. I'm excited to learn from the experts and enthusiasts here, and who knows, maybe even make some new friends along the way! Hi! I'm Lucia, a 21-year-old student on a mission to level up my coding skills. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon, not just to compete, but to learn and grow. I'm curious about making a difference in the tech world, and this is the perfect opportunity to experiment with new technologies and ideas. I'm passionate about bringing people together through innovative projects, and I'm looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts who share my enthusiasm for coding and creativity. See you around!
