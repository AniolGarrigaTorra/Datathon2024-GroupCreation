Hey there! As Astrid Rodriguez, my objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into learning and improvement. I've had minimal experience with programming so far, and I'm super excited to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. I'm looking forward to hands-on learning, taking feedback from mentors, and working on innovative projects that push me out of my comfort zone. My main goal is to return home with a bunch of new tricks up my sleeve, and I'm ready to put in the work to make it happen! Hey! I'm Astrid, a 17-year-old student who's obsessed with creativity and self-improvement. I'm entering the datathon with a clean slate, eager to dip my toes into the world of programming. I've always been drawn to music, art, and web design, and I'm excited to see how I can merge my passions with coding. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm looking forward to the challenge of tackling new projects and getting feedback from mentors. I'm all about learning and growth, and I'm ready to hustle to make the most of this experience!
