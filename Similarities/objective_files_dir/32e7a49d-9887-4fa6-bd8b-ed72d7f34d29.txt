Hey! So, I'm stoked to be here for the datathon and I'm super chill about making it an awesome experience. My objective is to meet new peeps, have a blast, and crush it in as many events as possible. I'm not super focused on winning or getting the best outcome - I'm more about building new connections, learning some new things, and just enjoying the vibes. I'm game for everything from coding sprints to panel discussions and even late-night gaming marathons. Let's make some unforgettable memories together! Hey y'all! I'm SÃ²nia, a 19-year-old second-year student who's stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm a people person, always looking to meet new faces and build some rad connections. When I'm not hitting the books, I love getting creative with code - whether it's tinkering with React Native or developing iOS apps. I'm super down-to-earth and all about having a good time. You can bet I'll be game for anything from impromptu dance parties to coding sprints and more. Let's do this, y'all!
