I'm all about learning and growing, so for this datathon, my main objective is to soak up as much knowledge as possible. I want to take on new challenges, practice my coding skills, and expand my tech capabilities. I'm hoping to collaborate with others and learn from their experiences, and I'm excited to tackle projects that push me out of my comfort zone. My ultimate goal is to emerge from this datathon with new skills, a refreshed perspective, and a sense of accomplishment - and who knows, maybe even a few new ideas to take back to my studies! Hey there! I'm Ana√Øs, a curious and ambitious 19-year-old student diving into my first datathon. I'm excited to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. With a passion for E-commerce and Retail, I'm always looking for innovative ways to merge tech with creativity. This datathon is all about embracing uncertainty and stepping out of my comfort zone. I'm ready to collaborate, learn from others, and come out with new skills, perspectives, and a sense of accomplishment. I'm excited to see what the weekend brings!
