Here's my objective:

My main goal for this datathon is to come out on top! I'm all about competition and I thrive under pressure. I've participated in a few hackathons before, and I've learned a thing or two about how to work well under tight deadlines. I'm here to put my skills to the test, crush some code, and claim that winning title. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Carolina! I'm a 21-year-old third-year student with a fire for coding and innovation. I've been around the block a few times, having participated in hackathons and competitions before. I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker, and I get pumped up when faced with a tough challenge. When I'm not studying, you can find me digging into the latest AR/VR trends or experimenting with cybersecurity techniques. My friends would describe me as a driven and creative person, always up for a challenge. I'm super excited to take on this datathon and show off my skills - let the competition begin!
