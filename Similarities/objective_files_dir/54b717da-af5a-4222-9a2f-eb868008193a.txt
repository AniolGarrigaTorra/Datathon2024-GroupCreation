I'm all about growth and self-improvement, so my objective is to focus on learning new things and boosting my skills. I'm excited to dive into new technologies and techniques, and learn from others who have more experience. I want to challenge myself to overcome obstacles and push my limits, and maybe even develop a new passion project. I'm not too concerned with winning or losing, as long as I come out of this feeling like I've grown as a programmer and ready to take on more challenging projects. Let's get coding and learning! Hi, I'm Sofia! I'm a 20-year-old student, and I'm excited to be here at the datathon. I've been interested in how technology can make a difference in people's lives, especially when it comes to IoT and security. As a beginner programmer, I'm always looking to learn new skills and push myself outside of my comfort zone. I believe that growth and self-improvement are key, and I'm hoping this datathon will be an opportunity for me to do just that. Let's get coding and see what we can achieve together!
