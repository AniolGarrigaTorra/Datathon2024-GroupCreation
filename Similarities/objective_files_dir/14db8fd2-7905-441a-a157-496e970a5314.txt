For me, this datathon is about one thing: competition. I've had my taste of success at a couple of hackathons before, and I'm hooked. I want to work hard, push myself to the limit, and beat the competition. Bring on the challenges, the all-nighters, and the thrill of victory - that's what gets me pumped! Hey there!
