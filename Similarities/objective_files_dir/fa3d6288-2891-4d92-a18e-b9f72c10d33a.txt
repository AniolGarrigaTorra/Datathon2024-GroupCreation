My main objective for this datathon is to focus on learning new things and improving my programming skills. I'm really eager to get my hands on some real-world projects and apply what I've learned so far in school. I know it's okay to start small, so I'm hoping to challenge myself with some smaller tasks and projects that will help me build my confidence. I'm excited to be surrounded by like-minded people and learn from their experiences too! Hey there! I'm Samantha Rachel Foster, an 18-year-old student with a passion for learning and growth. I'm currently in my first year and eager to put my beginner programming skills to the test. I'm excited to dive into new challenges and real-world projects, and to learn from others with similar interests. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm looking forward to taking it slow, building my confidence, and developing my skills. I'm a bit nervous but also thrilled to be part of this datathon and can't wait to see what's in store!
