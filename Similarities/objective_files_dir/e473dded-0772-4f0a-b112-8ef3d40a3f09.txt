Hey! I'm Sofía, and I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon. I'm really not here to compete or focus too much on winning (although, a little motivation never hurts). My main goal is to soak up this amazing experience, learn from others, and make some new friends along the way. I want to attend as many events as possible, join in on the coding sessions, and just enjoy the atmosphere. It's going to be a blast! Bring on the coding, the snacks, and the camaraderie - I'm ready for an unforgettable weekend! Hey everyone! I'm Sofía, a 19-year-old student with a passion for making a positive impact through technology. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I can learn from others, and share my own experiences. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me geeking out over machine learning, lifehacks, and innovative gadgets. My goal for this weekend is to soak up knowledge, have fun, and make some amazing friends. I'm a total newbie when it comes to competitions, but I'm up for the challenge!
