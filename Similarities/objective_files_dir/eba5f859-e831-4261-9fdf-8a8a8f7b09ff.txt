My objective for this datathon is straightforward - I want to dive head-first into learning and improving my skills. I've participated in 9 hackathons before, and each time I walk away with valuable experience, but also a few rough edges that need smoothing. I'm looking to refine my data analysis techniques, get more comfortable with machine learning libraries, and maybe even stumble upon a new passion project. Bring on the challenges, I'm ready to soak up every piece of knowledge and expertise the datathon has to offer! Hey, I'm Aur√©lie Elena Windsor, a passionate and ambitious PhD student. When I'm not geeking out over programming, you can find me jamming on my guitar or exploring the world of AR/VR. As a data enthusiast, I've had my fair share of hackathons, and each experience has only made me hungrier for more. This datathon, I'm looking to level up my skills, tackling projects that make a social impact and pushing myself to the limit. Bring on the coding challenges, I'm ready to flex my digital muscles and create something amazing!
