My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this experience and have a blast while doing it! I'm not too worried about winning, and I'd rather focus on learning new skills and techniques in a more relaxed atmosphere. My priority is to meet new people, form connections, and have fun while participating in various events and activities. I'm excited to see what this weekend has in store and to make some unforgettable memories with like-minded individuals! Hey there! I'm Ashley, a 22-year-old fourth-year student, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon! As a bit of a tech enthusiast, I love exploring new platforms and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or trying to optimize my productivity workflow. This weekend, I'm all about chilling with like-minded folk, learning some sweet new skills, and maybe even stumbling upon some unexpected surprises. Let's keep it laid-back and have some fun!
