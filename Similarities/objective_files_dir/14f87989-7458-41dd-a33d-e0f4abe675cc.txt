As a participant in this datathon, my objective is to dive deeper into machine learning and data visualization techniques while pushing my coding skills to the next level. I'm hoping to learn new tools, frameworks, and methodologies to help me tackle real-world problems. I'm not necessarily concerned with winning, but I do want to be able to walk away from this datathon with a solid understanding of the latest trends and a fresh perspective to apply to my studies and future projects. I'm looking forward to learning from others and gaining valuable experience! Hey everyone! I'm Anna Vidal, a third-year student looking forward to diving deeper into the world of data and coding during this datathon. As someone who's always fascinated by how technology can improve our lives, I'm excited to challenge myself and learn from others. With a curiosity-driven approach, I'm drawn to exploring innovative solutions that merge programming with real-world issues. I'm confident that this datathon will help me grow both personally and professionally, and I'm eager to share my own experiences and learn from yours. Let's code and innovate together!
