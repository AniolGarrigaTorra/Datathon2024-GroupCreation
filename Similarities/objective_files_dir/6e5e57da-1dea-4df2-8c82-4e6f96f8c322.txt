Hey! I'm Sofia Dupont, and my goal for this datathon is to take home that trophy. I've participated in a couple of hackathons before and have honed my skills to a decent level. Now, I'm here to put that to the test and show what I'm capable of. I'm looking forward to solving complex problems, crushing the competition, and, of course, taking advantage of the sweet, sweet prize money. It's gonna be a tough ride, but I'm ready to put in the hard work and dedication required to win. Hey there! I'm Sofia Dupont, a 21-year-old student with a passion for building innovative solutions. I've been hooked on coding since I was in school, and I'm proud to say I've gained a solid foundation in programming. In my free time, I enjoy staying ahead of the curve by exploring emerging tech like blockchain and IoT. I'm excited to join this datathon, challenge myself, and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create something awesome.
