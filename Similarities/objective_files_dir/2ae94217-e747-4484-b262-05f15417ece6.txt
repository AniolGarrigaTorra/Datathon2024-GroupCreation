Hey! I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! My goal is to make the most of this experience by having an amazing time with new people. I'm all about learning, growing, and taking in as many skills as I can, but this datathon is about vibing with like-minded folk and enjoying the journey! I'm not too fussed about the competition - I'd much rather jam together with fellow hackers, attend sick sessions, and try new snacks from the vending machines than obsess over winning. Can't wait to meet you all! Hey everyone! I'm Laurencia, a 26-year-old PhD student with a passion for tech and learning. When I'm not buried in my studies, you can find me geeking out over new coding languages, building crazy projects, or experimenting with innovative tools. I'm all about leveling up my skills and collaborating with fellow hackers. This datathon sounds like the perfect opportunity to connect with like-minded folks and explore new ideas - no competition pressure here, just good vibes and snacks! I'm stoked to be here and can't wait to meet you all!
