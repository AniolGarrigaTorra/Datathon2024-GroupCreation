I'm all about leveling up my skills at this datathon! My goal is to dive deeper into machine learning and AI, and come out with tangible projects that demonstrate my growth. I'm not too worried about winning; I'd rather focus on learning from others, taking calculated risks, and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. I'm excited to learn from the experts, get feedback on my work, and maybe even discover new areas of interest. Bring on the data and the challenges - I'm ready to soak it all in and come out a better developer on the other side! Hey! I'm Luna, a third-year student with a passion for pushing tech boundaries. I've dabbled in programming for a while now, but I'm eager to level up my skills and dive deeper into machine learning and AI. I'm a curious and creative problem solver, always looking for ways to combine my loves of art and technology. I'm excited to join this datathon, not just to learn from the best, but also to share my ideas and collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts. Bring on the data - I'm ready to get creative and see where it takes me!
