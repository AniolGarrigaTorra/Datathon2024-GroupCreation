My objective for this datathon is to challenge myself and deepen my understanding of data analysis. With only a year and a half left in my degree, I want to use this event to gain hands-on experience with new tools and technologies, and to refine my skills in data visualization and machine learning. I'm excited to learn from others and be pushed out of my comfort zone - even if it means making mistakes! Ultimately, I hope to take away valuable skills and knowledge that will benefit me in my future projects and career. Hey, I'm Alejandra Lane! I'm a 22-year-old student wrapping up my degree in a few months. I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon, as it's the perfect chance for me to take my skills to the next level. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of tech and data, and I'm looking forward to digging deeper into data analysis. With only a year and a half left of college, I'm eager to learn new tools and technologies to stay ahead of the game. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and take on the challenge!
