Hey there! My name is Aurora, and I'm stoked to be a part of this datathon. For me, this datathon is all about leveling up my skills and knowledge. I've participated in one hackathon before, but I feel like I've still got a lot to learn. My objective is to dive deep into new tech and explore areas that interest me the most, like data visualization and machine learning. I'm not too concerned about competing and winning (although, it's always a nice bonus); I'm more focused on learning, growing, and becoming a better developer by the end of this event. Hi everyone! I'm Aurora, a third-year student, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I've got a passion for learning and leveling up my skills, especially in areas that excite me like data visualization and machine learning. Outside of coding, I enjoy digging into lifehacks and all things quantum. For me, this datathon is about exploring new tech, growing as a developer, and having an amazing time with fellow enthusiasts. I'm a curious and friendly introvert, so feel free to chat with me about anything! Let's make some amazing projects and learn together!
