My goal for this datathon is to come out a better coder and a more well-rounded data enthusiast. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into machine learning and gaining hands-on experience with new tools and technologies. I'm excited to learn from other participants and receive feedback on my work. I'd love to walk away from this event with a sense of accomplishment and a portfolio of projects that showcase my growth as a developer. Bring on the challenges - I'm ready to level up my skills and take away something new and valuable! Hey there! I'm Sophie Roussel, a 21-year-old student fueled by my passion for problem-solving and creativity. With a solid foundation in programming and experience in tackling diverse projects, I'm always eager to take on new challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and value the opportunity to learn from others. During the datathon, I aim to leverage my existing skills to tackle exciting tasks and expand my knowledge in machine learning and other cutting-edge technologies. I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with fellow participants, and I'm looking forward to a valuable and fulfilling weekend of hacking!
