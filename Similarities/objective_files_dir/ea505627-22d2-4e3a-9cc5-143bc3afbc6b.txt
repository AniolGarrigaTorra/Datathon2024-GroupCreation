Hey! So, I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. Honestly, I'm not super competitive or anything, I just want to make the most of this experience and have a blast. My objective is to hang out, meet new people, and learn some new things, while also having an amazing time with fellow datathoners. I want to participate in as many events as I can, like workshops, ideathons, and chill hangs, to connect with others and make friends. Oh, and maybe, just maybe, something amazing comes out of all this - but primarily, it's all about the fun and friendship for me! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 17-year-old student, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! I'm all about learning and making connections, and I'm looking forward to soaking up as much as I can from this incredible experience. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me belting out my favorite tunes or losing myself in art. I'm all about making the most of life, and I'm excited to meet like-minded people who share my passion for self-discovery and creativity. Let's have some fun and make some unforgettable memories, datathoners!
