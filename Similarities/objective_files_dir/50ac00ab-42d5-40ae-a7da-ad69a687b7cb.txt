Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is pretty straightforward: I want to improve my skills and learn new things. With 5 hackathons under my belt, I'm looking to take my programming skills to the next level and experiment with new technologies. I'm hoping to push myself out of my comfort zone and learn from others in the community. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring areas like machine learning and data visualization, so I'd love to attend talks and workshops related to those topics. Let's see how far we can take our skills this weekend! Hey there! I'm Emily, a 20-year-old student with a passion for programming and a thirst for adventure. With three years of experience under my belt, I've gained a solid foundation in software development. I've always been fascinated by the world of tech and its endless possibilities. For this datathon, I'm eager to challenge myself and take my skills to new heights. I'm interested in machine learning and data visualization, and I'm looking forward to learning from others and sharing my own insights. Let's see where the weekend takes us!
