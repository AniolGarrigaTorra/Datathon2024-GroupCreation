Hey there! So, I'm Ruby Windsor, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! I'm not exactly a competitive rockstar (I've participated in 5 hackathons, and let's just say I've had my fair share of wins and...not-so-wins), but I'm all about makin' new friends and havin' a blast! My objective is to soak up all the fun vibes, learn some new cool skills, and participate in as many events as I can handle. If I happen to win, that's just the cherry on top! Hey there! I'm Ruby Windsor, and I'm thrilled to be a part of this datathon! I'm a fourth-year student with a passion for innovation and self-improvement. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me spinning sick beats or dabbling in digital art. I'm stoked to be here, learn new tricks, and make new friends! I'm all about having a blast, making unforgettable memories, and who knows, maybe even scoring some awesome skills. Can't wait to see what this datathon has in store for us!
