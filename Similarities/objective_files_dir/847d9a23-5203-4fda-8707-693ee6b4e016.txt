For me, this datathon is all about making the most of this amazing opportunity to connect with like-minded folks and have a blast! I'm looking forward to networking, participating in as many events as possible, and just enjoying the vibes. I'm not super competitive, so I won't be stressing about winning. I just want to meet new people, learn some cool things, and take part in some awesome challenges. Who knows, maybe I'll even find my next coding buddy! Let's have a fantastic time and make unforgettable memories Hey there! I'm Esther Sof√≠a Braun, a 21-year-old third-year student with a passion for coding. I've spent countless hours tinkering with different programming languages and tech frameworks, and I'm always on the lookout for new tools and methods to spice up my workflow. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me dabbling in data visualization or exploring the intersection of technology and commerce. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon, and I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded folks and learning from each other's experiences.
