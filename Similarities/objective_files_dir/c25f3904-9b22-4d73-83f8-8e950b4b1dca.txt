My main objective for this datathon is to have a blast and make some new buddies along the way! I'm not particularly worried about winning, as I've had my share of hackathons and know I can hold my own. Instead, I'm excited to participate in as many events and activities as possible, learn from others, and share my own knowledge and experience. I'd love to connect with like-minded folks, make some unforgettable memories, and take a load off - literally, as this'll be a much-needed break from my studies! See you around, fellow datathon enthusiasts! Hey there! I'm Marta, a 20-year-old student, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! When I'm not buried in textbooks, I'm coding my heart out and tinkering with new tech. I've got a soft spot for using tech to make a positive impact, whether it's improving healthcare or education. I'm all about collaboration, so you can bet I'm excited to meet fellow datathon enthusiasts and share my passion for innovation. Let's make some unforgettable memories and have a blast while doing it!
