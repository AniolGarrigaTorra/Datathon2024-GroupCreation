My objective for this datathon is simple: to crush the competition and take home the top prize! I've been grinding away at coding problems for years, and I'm eager to put my skills to the test against some of the best and brightest minds out there. I'm a competitive person at heart, and I thrive under the pressure of a tight deadline. My goal is to stay focused, work smart, and innovate quickly to deliver a winning solution. No games, no distractions - I'm all in on winning. Hey there! I'm Soledad, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast with a knack for innovation. Currently in my third year of university, I've been hooked on software development since I first dipped my toes in coding. I'm passionate about taking complex ideas and bringing them to life. With a taste for competition and a dash of stubborn determination, I'm all about pushing the boundaries and going for the top. When the clock ticks down and the pressure rises, I thrive!
