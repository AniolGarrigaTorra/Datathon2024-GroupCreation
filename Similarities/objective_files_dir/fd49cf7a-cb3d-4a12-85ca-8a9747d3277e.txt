My objective for this datathon is to dive deeper into learning new programming skills and techniques. With only a few more years until I graduate, I want to use this event as an opportunity to challenge myself and push my limits. I'm hoping to learn from other participants and experts in the field, and get a chance to work on projects that might not be part of my usual coursework. I'm excited to experiment with different tools and technologies, and who knows, maybe even stumble upon a new passion! Hey there! I'm Maria, a third-year student diving into the world of computer science. I've had some experience with programming, and I'm excited to take on new challenges. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and innovation, and I'm looking forward to learning from others at this datathon. As someone who loves tinkering with different tools and trying new things, I'm hoping to explore different areas of expertise and possibly stumble upon a new passion. Let's make the most of this datathon and create something amazing together!
