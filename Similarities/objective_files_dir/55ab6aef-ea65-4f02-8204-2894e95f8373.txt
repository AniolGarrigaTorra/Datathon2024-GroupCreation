Hey! My objective for this datathon is to soak up the experience, meet new people, and have a blast! I want to participate in as many events and workshops as I can, learn new skills, and connect with like-minded individuals. I'm all about having fun and making new friends. I don't really care about winning or competing; I'd rather hang out with the team, collaborate on projects, and share my passion for data analytics. Can't wait to meet you all and start this adventure! Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a 23-year-old grad student with a passion for data analytics and all things creative. When I'm not crunching numbers, I love digging into design and communication projects. My ultimate goal is to blend data with art to tell stories that inspire. This datathon is a dream come true for me - I'm all about connecting with like-minded folks, learning from the best, and having a blast. I'm more interested in the journey than the prize, and I'm excited to collaborate and create unforgettable memories with you all. Let's make some waves!
