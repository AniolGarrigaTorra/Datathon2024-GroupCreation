My objective for this datathon is to have a blast while meeting new people! I'm not super worried about winning - I'm still honing my skills, but I'm more interested in soaking up all the experience I can get. I'm excited to participate in as many events and workshops as possible, learn new tools and techniques, and connect with fellow participants who share my passion for data. It's gonna be a weekend of fun, friends, and personal growth - bring it on! Hey, I'm Sof√≠a! A curious and enthusiastic 20-year-old student, always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow. As a third-year student, I'm fascinated by the power of data and its applications in various fields, from health to education. This datathon is a fantastic chance for me to network with like-minded individuals, stay updated on the latest tools and techniques, and develop my skills in real-world projects. I'm all about collaboration, creativity, and having a blast! Looking forward to an incredible experience and making new friends along the way!
