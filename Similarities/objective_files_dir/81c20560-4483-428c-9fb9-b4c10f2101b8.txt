Hey there! I'm María Isabella Gutiérrez, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! For me, it's all about having a blast and making new friends along the way. I don't really care about winning or placing high, my goal is to soak up as much as I can from this event and have an amazing time doing it. I want to attend every workshop, participate in every challenge, and network with fellow participants. I'm looking forward to learning new skills, trying out new tools, and meeting like-minded people. Let's have some fun and make this datathon unforgettable! Hi everyone! I'm María Isabella Gutiérrez, a 20-year-old student with a passion for data and technology. I'm entering this datathon with an open mind and a love for learning. As a 2nd-year student, I'm excited to dive into new challenges and absorb as much knowledge as possible. My favorite aspects of coding are designing user-friendly interfaces and analyzing data to tell compelling stories. When I'm not tinkering with code, I love staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends and innovations. I'm eager to connect with fellow participants and create unforgettable memories during this datathon!
