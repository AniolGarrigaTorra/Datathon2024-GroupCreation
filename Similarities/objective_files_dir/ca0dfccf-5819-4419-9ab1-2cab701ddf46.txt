I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My goal is to make the most of this experience and have an absolute blast while doing it. I want to meet new people, learn from them, and work together to create something amazing. I'm not too worried about winning or losing - for me, it's all about having fun, making new friends, and learning new things along the way. I'm looking forward to participating in as many events as I can, trying out different activities, and taking part in workshops and talks. Let's make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Montserrat, a 19-year-old student and datathon newbie. I'm thrilled to be here, ready to embark on an exciting adventure with a fantastic group of people. I'm all about learning, growing, and having a blast - in that order! With a passion for music, art, and productivity, I'm constantly seeking new ways to boost my creativity and stay organized. I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, and I'm eager to collaborate with others who share my love for innovation. Let's make some unforgettable memories together!
