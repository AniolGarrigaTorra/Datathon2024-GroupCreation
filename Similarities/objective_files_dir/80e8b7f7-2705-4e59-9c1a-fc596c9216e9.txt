Hey! My goal for this datathon is all about community over competition! I'm super stoked to meet new people, learn from them, and just have an awesome time. I'm looking forward to taking part in as many events as possible, from workshops to gaming sessions, and making some unforgettable memories. I'm not too worried about winning or getting a prize (although, who wouldn't love one?!). For me, this datathon is about forming genuine connections, trying new things, and just having a blast! Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Anna, a 22-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems using code. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkering with robotic process automation or experimenting with lifehacks. I'm all about embracing innovation and making things happen with ease. With a background in programming, I'm excited to dive into new tech challenges and network with like-minded folks. This datathon is my chance to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and make meaningful connections with the community. I'm all about collaboration over competition - let's have some fun!
