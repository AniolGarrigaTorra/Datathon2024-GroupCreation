I'm super stoked to be a part of this datathon! My goal is to learn as much as I can and improve my programming skills. I'm only in my first year of university, and while I've had some basic courses, I know I've got a lot to catch up on. I'm looking forward to immersing myself in the world of data and seeing what cool projects people come up with. Ideally, I'd love to learn some new tools and programming languages, and maybe even start to contribute to some open-source projects. I'm hoping this datathon will give me a great opportunity to do just that! Hi there! I'm LÃ©onie, a first-year university student with a passion for learning and improving my skills. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon, where I hope to dive deeper into the world of data and programming. As a beginner in the tech world, I'm looking forward to learning from others, improving my skills, and maybe even contributing to some amazing projects. My goal is to soak up as much knowledge as I can and make the most of this experience. I'm ready to dive in and see what this datathon has in store for me!
