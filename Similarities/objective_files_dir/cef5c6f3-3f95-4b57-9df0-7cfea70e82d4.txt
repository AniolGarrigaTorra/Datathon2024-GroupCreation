I'm Ana, and for this datathon, my main goal is to step out of my comfort zone and improve my skills in machine learning and data analysis. I'm excited to learn new techniques and get hands-on experience working with different datasets. I hope to come away with a better understanding of how to apply AI to real-world problems and maybe even discover new areas of interest. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other participants and getting feedback from mentors - my objective is to learn and grow as much as possible over the next 24 hours! Hi! I'm Ana, a 21-year-old computer science student with a passion for exploring innovative technologies. With a strong background in programming, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of computer science and reality. Whether it's building virtual worlds, improving healthcare outcomes, or analyzing large datasets, I'm excited to dive into new challenges. For this datathon, I'm looking forward to pushing my limits and gaining hands-on experience with machine learning and data analysis. Let's collaborate and learn from each other over the next 24 hours!
