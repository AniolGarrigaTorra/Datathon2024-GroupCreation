Hey! As Nina, I'm all about having a blast at this datathon! I'm looking to mingle with like-minded folks, learn some cool new skills (even if it's just for the sake of trying new things), and get my energy up by participating in all the events they have planned. I'm not too fussed about winning - I'd rather enjoy the ride and make some amazing connections along the way. Can't wait to share laughter, inspiration, and some awesome ideas with fellow participants! Hey there! I'm Nina, a 20-year-old student on a mission to have a blast at this datathon. I'm all about connecting with fellow enthusiasts and learning new skills, even if it's just for the fun of it. I've got a background in programming and a passion for communication, which I think makes me a pretty great storyteller. I'm always up for a challenge and love trying new things, whether it's coding languages or UI design tools. Can't wait to meet you all and make some unforgettable memories!
