I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! My objective is to make new friends, have a blast, and squeeze in as many awesome events as possible. I'd love to meet like-minded people, share laughs, and maybe even collaborate on a cool project. While I'm a bit of a beginner in the coding world, I'm all about taking in new experiences and knowledge too. Can't wait to geek out with you all! Hey there! I'm Caterina, a 21-year-old student thrilled to be part of this datathon. With a bit of programming experience under my belt, I'm excited to meet fellow enthusiasts and learn from each other. When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming or indulging in my love for music, art, and design. My ultimate goal for this event is to make unforgettable memories and connections while exploring new tech opportunities. Let's geek out together and see what exciting experiences this datathon brings!
