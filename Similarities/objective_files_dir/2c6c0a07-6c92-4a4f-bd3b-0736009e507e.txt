Hey there! My objective for this datathon is simple - I'm all about the win. I've participated in four hackathons before, and I'm not about to slow down now. I'm pumped to put my skills to the test and come out on top. I'm expecting to learn some new tricks along the way, but my primary goal is to take home that trophy. I'm planning to devote as much time as possible to problem-solving, collaborate with other top teams, and bring my A-game to every challenge. Nothing less than victory will do! Hey everyone! I'm Emily, a 21-year-old college student pumped to be part of this datathon. With four hackathons under my belt, I'm no stranger to high-pressure programming. My passion lies in leveraging technology to simplify processes and create value. I'm all about maximizing efficiency, and I'm excited to put my skills to the test. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over latest advancements in AI and ML or trying out new web development tools. Ready to tackle some exciting challenges and learn from an amazing group of folks like me!
