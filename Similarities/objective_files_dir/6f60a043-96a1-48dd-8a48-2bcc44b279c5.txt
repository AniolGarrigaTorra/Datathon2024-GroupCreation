My objective for this datathon is to bring home that top prize! I've got my sights set on the trophy and I'm not leaving until I've given it my all. I've participated in a few hackathons before, so I'm confident in my abilities, but I know it won't be easy. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and crush the competition. My strategy will be to focus on finding a solid idea, building it fast and efficiently, and then refining it until it's perfect. I'm ready to put in the extra hours to get ahead of the pack and be crowned the winner. Hey there! I'm Lila Jane Thompson, a 19-year-old coding enthusiast. When I'm not buried in textbooks or scouring the web for the latest coding challenges, I love tinkering with creative projects that combine art and tech. For me, coding is about finding innovative solutions to make life easier and more enjoyable. That's why I'm super excited to participate in this datathon - I'm all about finding and building that killer idea that makes a real difference. Bring on the challenge, and let's see where the ride takes us!
