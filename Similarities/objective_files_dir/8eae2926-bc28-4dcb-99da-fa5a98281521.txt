My objective for this datathon is simple - I'm here to learn and level up my skills! As a 4th-year student, I've had some solid experience in programming, but I know there's always room for growth. I'm excited to dive into new tech, explore different approaches, and soak up knowledge from other participants and mentors. My goal is to come away from this event with fresh ideas, improved coding chops, and a sense of accomplishment. No pressure to win - I'm all about the learning experience! Hey there, I'm Rafaelo! I'm a 22-year-old fourth-year student with a passion for using tech for good. I've dived deep into programming, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing. I'm all about exploring new tech and discovering fresh perspectives. Outside of coding, I love music, art, and gaming - anything that brings me joy and stimulates my creativity. For this datathon, I'm looking forward to an intense learning experience, meeting like-minded folks, and walking away with a newfound sense of accomplishment. Let's level up our skills and rock this datathon!
