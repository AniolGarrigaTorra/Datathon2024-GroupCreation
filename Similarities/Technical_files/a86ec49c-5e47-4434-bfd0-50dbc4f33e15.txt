I had an absolute blast working on a personal project that combined my love for music and art with programming! I created a chatbot using Natural Language Processing that helped users discover new artists based on their musical preferences. I designed the UI using Figma and developed the chatbot's logic in Swift. It was an incredible feeling seeing my project come to life and watching people enjoy it. The technical challenge and creative freedom were exhilarating, and I learned so much along the way. It was a great reminder that programming can be used to bring joy and make a positive impact! As I look ahead to the next decade, I'm thrilled to see myself working on a project that utilizes my passion for Social Good, Education, and Mobile to create a revolutionary, blockchain-powered education platform. This platform would allow underprivileged children around the world to access quality educational resources and connect with mentors through a mobile app. I envision a seamless, community-driven experience where users can create, curate, and share valuable knowledge and skills, bridging the gap between developed and developing nations. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to push the boundaries of what's possible in education.
