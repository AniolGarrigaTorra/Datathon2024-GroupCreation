I recently worked on a side project to develop a simple music recommendation system using Flutter. I built a frontend app that allows users to create a playlist and receive personalized song suggestions based on their preferences. The backend was powered by a SQLite database and utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate recommendations. I enjoyed the challenge of combining my interests in music and programming to create a practical and functional application. It was an amazing experience to see my project come to life and I'm now exploring ways to further develop and deploy it! I'm thrilled to think about the projects that excite me for the future! As a student of programming, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be a part of a team that develops AI-powered augmented reality applications that merge music, art, and gaming. Imagine immersive experiences where users can create, collaborate, and interact with each other in a virtual world. I'd be working on building the voice skills that make this AR world accessible and enjoyable for everyone. That's a dream project that excites me and pushes me to grow as a developer!
