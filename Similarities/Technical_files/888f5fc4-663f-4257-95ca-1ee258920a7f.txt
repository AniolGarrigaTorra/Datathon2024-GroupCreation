One project that stands out to me is a computer vision-based app I built with Flutter, which could detect and recognize different plants using machine learning algorithms. I was really excited to combine my interests in Design and Computer Vision to create something visually appealing and functional. I enjoyed learning about mobile development, deep learning, and experimenting with various approaches to improve the app's accuracy. It was a great feeling to see my project come to life and knowing that it could potentially help people identify plants more easily. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I'm looking forward to building on that foundation! I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastic about developing smart, sustainable cities! In the next decade, I'd love to contribute to the creation of urban environments that seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and IoT technologies to enhance citizens' quality of life. Imagine virtual walkways that guide you to your destination while monitoring air quality, traffic flow, and energy consumption in real-time. As a student, I've begun dabbling in computer vision and blockchain, and I'm eager to explore how these technologies can shape the future of urban infrastructure and urban planning.
