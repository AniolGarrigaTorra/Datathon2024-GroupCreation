I had an absolute blast working on a Figma project with my high school graphics team. We were tasked with rebranding our school's logo, and I was thrilled to be a part of it. I used Figma's design tools to create a modern and fresh design that our school really loved. What I enjoyed most was collaborating with my teammates and receiving feedback. We worked together to iterate on the design, and it was so satisfying to see it come to life. It was a fantastic experience that taught me the importance of communication, adaptability, and creative freedom! As I look ahead, I'm thrilled to imagine the potential impact of combining my passion for design, communication, and health with the rapidly evolving field of Quantum Technology. I envision developing user-centered, augmented reality platforms that utilize Machine Learning and IoT to enhance patients' experiences, streamlining healthcare workflows, and fostering more personalized care. By doing so, I aim to make healthcare more accessible, transparent, and human-centric. It's a lofty goal, but I'm convinced that by 2030, I'll be working on a revolutionary project that will have a meaningful, real-world impact, and I'm stoked to take that first step at the datathon!
