I had so much fun working on a non-technical project, actually a school exhibition on environmental issues! I got to merge my passions for Design and Communication to create an interactive board game that educated people about the impact of human activities on the environment. I designed the game's visual identity, wrote the narrative, and even created a custom soundtrack. Seeing people play and discuss the game, sharing knowledge and perspectives, was super rewarding. It showed me that, beyond coding, I can make a difference through creative storytelling and problem-solving! I'm excited to dive into a field that combines my passions for design, DevOps, and enterprise - augmented reality infrastructure for smart cities. I envision a future where buildings, streets, and public spaces are equipped with interactive, data-driven overlays that enhance the daily lives of citizens. Imagine being able to walk into a city and being alerted to available parking spots, pollution levels, or health advice through subtle, visually stunning displays. I'd love to contribute to building this reality, blending programming, design, and strategic thinking to create seamless, intuitive, and life-changing experiences.
