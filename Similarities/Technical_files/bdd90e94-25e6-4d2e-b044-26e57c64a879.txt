One of my favorite projects is a school management system I built with my friends during a hackathon. We used Flutter to create a cross-platform app that allowed teachers to manage students, attendance, and grades. I was responsible for the backend, using Java to connect to a MySQL database. It was a challenging project, but seeing the finished product come together was so rewarding. I loved working on something that had a real-world impact, knowing that our system could make life easier for teachers and administrators. Plus, it was a great way to practice my skills and collaborate with others. I'm excited to work on projects that have a tangible impact on people's lives. In the next 10 years, I'd love to develop AI-powered education platforms that use machine learning to personalize learning experiences for underprivileged children. I envision AI-driven adaptive curriculum, virtual mentorship, and access to resources and career guidance. The potential to improve educational outcomes, increase accessibility, and foster equal opportunities in the face of social and economic disparities is both thrilling and intimidating. My goal is to contribute to a future where every child has the chance to flourish, and technology empowers rather than excludes.
