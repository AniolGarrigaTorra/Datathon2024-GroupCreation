I've really enjoyed working on a non-technical project - a social media campaign to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene in my community. As a volunteer, I designed and managed a social media campaign using organic reach, targeted ads, and influencer partnerships to educate people about the importance of menstrual hygiene management. I created engaging content, tracked performance metrics, and adapted our strategy accordingly. Seeing the impact on the community and collaborating with other volunteers made it incredibly fulfilling. I learned a ton about social media marketing and its power to drive social change! As a developer passionate about social good and fintech, I'm eager to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible financial infrastructure for underprivileged communities. In the next decade, I envision building a blockchain-based platform that empowers underserved individuals to manage their finances, gain access to credit, and participate in the digital economy. By leveraging AI-driven fraud detection and data-driven decision making, this platform will promote financial inclusion and resilience. It's a lofty goal, but I'm excited to collaborate with fellow innovators and stakeholders to make it a reality, and I believe my participation in this datathon will be a crucial step in making that dream a possibility.
