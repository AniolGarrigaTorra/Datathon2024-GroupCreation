I recently worked on a hackathon project that uses machine learning to help monitor and reduce food waste in local restaurants. I built a web app that leverages image recognition to classify food items as edible or expired, and provides restaurants with recommendations on what to sell or discard. It was an incredible project to work on, and the best part was collaborating with the restaurant owner to identify pain points and refine the solution. I'm stoked to say that I'm fascinated by the potential of AI-powered tools in enhancing healthcare and access to quality medical services, particularly in underserved communities. As someone passionate about social good, I'd love to explore the development of an AI-driven telemedicine platform that leverages machine learning and natural language processing to enable remote consultations, diagnostic assessments, and personalized treatment plans. This would revolutionize the way we approach healthcare, bridging the gap between patients and medical professionals worldwide. My goal is to join forces with like-minded individuals and make this vision a reality within the next decade!
