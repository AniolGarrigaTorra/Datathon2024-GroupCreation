Man, I'm stoked to share this project with you! So, last semester, I worked on a project to build a smart home automation system using IoT and Go. It was a solo project, and I designed a user-friendly app using React Native that controlled various appliances in my apartment, like lights, fans, and TV. I also implemented natural language processing to enable voice commands through Google Assistant. It was amazing to see everything come together and knowing that I could control my home's temperature and lighting from my bed. It was such a thrilling experience, and I can't wait to dive into more projects like this! As a lifehack enthusiast, I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and urban infrastructure. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing smart city solutions that incorporate IoT, machine learning, and blockchain to create more efficient, sustainable, and connected urban environments. I envision a future where buildings adapt to occupants' needs in real-time, public transportation is seamless, and city resources are optimized through data-driven decision making. This aligns with my enterprise focus and allows me to leverage my tech skills for a greater social impact - it's a dream project for me!
