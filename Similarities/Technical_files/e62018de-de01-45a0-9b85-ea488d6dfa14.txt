I'm a big fan of side projects! Lately, I've been dabbling in iOS development, and I built an app that helps customers track their shopping habits at local thrift stores. I used Swift and integrated it with a custom backend on AWS Lambda. The app uses barcode scanning to track items and generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences. What I enjoyed most was experimenting with data visualization to represent shopping trends and item relationships. It's still a work in progress, but it's awesome to see something I created have a real-world impact! I'm thrilled to share my ambitions! In the next 10 years, I'm passionate about creating a sustainable e-commerce platform that leverages machine learning and data visualization to promote socially responsible consumption habits. Imagine an online shopping experience that not only recommends products based on user preferences but also encourages conscious purchasing decisions by displaying environmental and social impact metrics. By integrating machine learning algorithms with data visualization tools, we can inspire customers to make informed choices that benefit both themselves and the planet. This platform would be a game-changer for reducing carbon footprint and promoting a more mindful consumption culture.
