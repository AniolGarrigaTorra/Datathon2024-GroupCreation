One project that I absolutely loved working on is my personal blog's redesign using React Native! I wanted to create a seamless, intuitive mobile experience for my readers. I designed the UI/UX, implemented it using React Native, and integrated it with the existing database. It was amazing to see the difference in user engagement and feedback after the redesign. It's projects like these that make me grateful for being a student and having the time to explore and create something that brings me joy. I hope to apply similar skills and enthusiasm to my datathon projects! What a great question! In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to make a meaningful impact in the field of artificial intelligence and its application to social good. I've always been fascinated by the potential of AI to improve lives, and I'd love to contribute to projects that use machine learning to address pressing global challenges like climate change, healthcare, and education. Imagine developing AI-powered platforms that help detect diseases earlier, or use natural language processing to improve language accessibility for people with disabilities. I'm excited to explore these possibilities and push the boundaries of what's possible!
