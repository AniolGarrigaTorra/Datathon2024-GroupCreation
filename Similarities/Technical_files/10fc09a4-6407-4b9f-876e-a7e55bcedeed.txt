I've been obsessed with creating a mobile app that helps people with anxiety track and manage their mental well-being. I called it CalmDown. As an iOS developer, I built it using Swift and integrating it with the HealthKit to track users' vital signs. I used machine learning with TensorFlow to analyze their data and provide personalized recommendations. I even added a feature that allows users to share their feelings anonymously with a support community. Seeing the positive impact it had on friends and family who used it was incredibly rewarding. It was my first real-world application and I'm proud of what I achieved! As I look ahead to the next 10 years, I'm extremely excited to contribute to the development of a global, AI-powered platform that utilizes blockchain technology to revolutionize access to quality healthcare in underserved communities. Imagine a world where patients can seamlessly connect with doctors and specialists, access medical records, and receive personalized treatment recommendations - all through a user-friendly, mobile app. With my background in Python, TensorFlow, and blockchain, I'm eager to bring my skills to a team that shares my passion for making a positive impact on the world, one line of code at a time.
