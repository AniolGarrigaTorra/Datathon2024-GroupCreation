I recently worked on a non-technical project, building a virtual reality experience for my friends and family. We were going through a tough time, and I wanted to create something that would bring us together and provide some relief. Using Unity and AR/VR software, I created an interactive experience that allowed us to explore a simulated world, solve puzzles, and have fun together. It was an incredible feeling to see the impact it had on our relationships and see everyone smiling and laughing together again. It was an amazing experience, and I loved seeing people connect in a new way. I'm thrilled to say that I'm excited to work on building an immersive virtual reality platform that revolutionizes the way we communicate and learn from each other. Imagine being able to step into a virtual world where you can engage in real-life conversations with people from diverse backgrounds, languages, and cultures, all through the power of AR/VR. I envision this platform becoming a global tool for bridging the gaps between nations, fostering empathy, and promoting cultural understanding. With the advancements in tech, I believe this dream can become a reality in the next 10 years, and I'm excited to be part of that journey!
