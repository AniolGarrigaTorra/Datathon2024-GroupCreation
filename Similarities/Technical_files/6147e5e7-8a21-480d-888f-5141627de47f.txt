I recently worked on a personal project where I used computer vision and HTML/CSS to create an interactive art exhibit. I used JavaScript to analyze the visitor's movement and adjust the artwork's patterns and colors in real-time. It was amazing to see how people's movements influenced the art and how they interacted with it. It was a great exercise in creativity and technical problem-solving. I enjoyed experimenting with different algorithms and techniques to achieve the desired effect. It was also cool to share it with friends and family and see their reactions! As I envision the next decade, I'm bursting with excitement thinking about developing an augmented reality platform that revolutionizes mental healthcare. Imagine a world where patients can use immersive experiences to confront and overcome phobias, anxieties, and traumas in a safe, interactive, and controlled environment. I'd leverage my passion for computer vision and web development to create a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with cutting-edge tech. The prospect of making a tangible impact on people's lives, empowering them to tackle their mental health struggles, is what gets me pumped and driven to keep pushing boundaries.
