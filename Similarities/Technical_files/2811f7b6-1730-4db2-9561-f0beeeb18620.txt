One project that really stood out to me was a volunteer app I built with a friend for a local food bank. We used React, GraphQL, and MongoDB to create an app that allowed users to track their food donations and volunteers to sign up for shifts. The best part was working with the food bank team to identify their needs and designing an intuitive UI. Seeing people use our app and make a difference in the community made it all worth it! It was a great opportunity to balance technical skills with social impact, and I felt like I was making a real difference. As I look to the next 10 years, I'm genuinely excited to contribute to the development of accessible, user-friendly, and empowering technologies that can benefit the underprivileged and marginalized communities. Specifically, I'm passionate about integrating Blockchain technology with IoT sensors to create decentralized and community-driven health monitoring systems for remote areas. Imagine being able to monitor vital signs, track health conditions, and access medical guidance remotely, without relying on traditional infrastructure or administrative bureaucracy. This fusion of technologies has the potential to revolutionize global healthcare, and I'd be thrilled to be a part of it.
