I had so much fun working on a music recommendation system project! It was a tech project, and I used my UI/UX design skills to create a visually appealing interface. I used Python and a library called Last.fm to create a algorithm that analyzes the listening habits of users and suggests new music based on their taste. What I loved most about this project was seeing how it came together and actually working! It was amazing to see how my designs and code came to life, and I was thrilled to learn how to create something that could potentially help people discover new music they love. I'm thrilled to share my long-term aspiration! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on a blockchain-based healthcare platform that empowers individuals to take control of their medical data. Imagine a decentralized ecosystem where patients can securely store and share their health records, reducing barriers to accessing quality care. I envision a user-friendly interface that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify high-risk patient populations, facilitating targeted interventions and more efficient care delivery. With data analysis and visualization, this platform would revolutionize healthcare, promoting transparency, equity, and better outcomes.
