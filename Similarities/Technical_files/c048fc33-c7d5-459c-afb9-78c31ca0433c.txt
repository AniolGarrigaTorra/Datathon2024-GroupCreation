I had a blast working on a project to build a voice-controlled AI music composition tool using Blockchain and Computer Vision! It was a really unique blend of skills. I trained a CNN to generate MIDI files based on images of music theory diagrams, and then used a natural language processing model to analyze and respond to voice commands. The result was a interactive music system that could create and modify compositions in real-time. It was amazing to see the AI generating music and adjusting it based on voice inputs. Such a cool project, and I learned so much! I'm absolutely thrilled to think about the cutting-edge projects I'll be a part of in the next decade! In the next 10 years, I envision working on developing artificial intelligence-driven prosthetic limbs that seamlessly integrate with the human body. Using advancements in computer vision, natural language processing, and AR/VR, these prosthetics will enable individuals with physical disabilities to regain full control over their daily lives. Imagine a world where people with amputations can effortlessly play sports, write art, or simply hold their loved ones' hands - that's the future I'm working towards, and it gives me goosebumps!
