I loved working on a project that aimed to develop an AI-powered productivity assistant using AR/VR. I used my Android Development skills to create a mobile app that integrated with a Raspberry Pi-powered AR headset. It was amazing to see how I could use my tech skills to create something that could potentially revolutionize the way we work. The project allowed me to explore the intersection of technology and creativity, and it was incredible to see how far we could push the boundaries of innovation. As a student, I'm thrilled about the prospects of advancing AR/VR technology. In the next decade, I envision myself being part of a revolutionary project that merges augmented reality with everyday applications, making it an indispensable tool for everyone. I'd love to work on an AI-powered assistant that seamlessly integrates with our surroundings, providing personalized experiences, and enhancing our daily routines. Imagine, for instance, walking into your home, and an AR-powered agent welcoming you, adjusting the temperature, lighting, and music to create a tailored ambiance for a cozy evening - that's the future I'm dreaming of!
