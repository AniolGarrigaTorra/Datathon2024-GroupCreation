I had an absolute blast working on my school project, Rhythm Rebel, a music-based AR game! As a music lover and UI/UX enthusiast, I designed a Figma layout for a futuristic music station where players can control beats and rhythms by tapping on glowing orbs. For the backend, I collaborated with a team member to build the game logic using Java and TensorFlow. Seeing our design come to life in AR was exhilarating! The experience not only showcased my creativity but also taught me the importance of teamwork and rapid prototyping. I'm eager to explore more projects that merge technology and art. I'm incredibly passionate about Education Technology, and I can't wait to see where it takes us in the next 10 years! I envision a future where AI-powered adaptive learning platforms revolutionize the way we educate ourselves and others. With advancements in natural language processing and machine learning, I see personalized learning becoming the norm. Imagine having a personalized AI tutor that learns and adjusts to your learning style, pace, and strengths. The possibilities are endless, and I'm thrilled to be a part of shaping the next generation of education. Bring on the coding and brainstorming sessions, I'm ready to dive in!
