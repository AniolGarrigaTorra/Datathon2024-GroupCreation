Man, I've got to give a shoutout to my side project, ElderCare. I built a voice-assisted reminder system for my grandma who has dementia. She'd often forget to take her meds or appointments, and it was stressing me out. I taught an old Alexa to recognize her voice and reminders. It was a huge win for me (and Grandma!) when I saw her responding to voice commands and feeling more independent. Tech-wise, it was a great experience working with Python and Alexa's SDK. Non-tech-wise, it was an awesome reminder of the impact tech can have on people's lives. I'm truly passionate about harnessing the power of technology to drive positive change. My long-term aspiration is to develop an AI-powered platform that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to empower individuals with mental health conditions, providing them with personalized coping strategies and community support. I envision a virtual companion that offers empathy, validation, and resources, ultimately leading to a significant decrease in mental health stigma and increased well-being worldwide. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm confident that the intersection of AI, design, and social good has the potential to spark meaningful transformation.
