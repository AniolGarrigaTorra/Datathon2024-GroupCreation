I absolutely loved working on a project where I used React Native to build a simple AI-powered chatbot for a friend's game development startup. I got to combine my passion for machine learning with my interest in gaming, and it was so rewarding to see the chatbot come to life! I trained the model using PyTorch, and then integrated it with React Native to create a seamless user experience. It was a non-technical project in the sense that it wasn't aimed at solving a complex problem, but more about applying my skills to something fun and creative. I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I'm determined to create a comprehensive AI-powered platform that bridges the gap between individuals with disabilities and inclusive social environments. The platform, titled EchoPals, aims to develop customizable voice assistant technologies, allowing people with speech or hearing impairments to connect and communicate with others, breaking down social barriers. By harnessing machine learning and natural language processing, EchoPals will empower individuals to freely participate in social interactions, community events, and creative endeavors, promoting social cohesion and inclusivity on a global scale.
