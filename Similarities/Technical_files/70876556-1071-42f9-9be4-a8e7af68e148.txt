Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share this project with you! Last semester, I worked on a non-technical project with my friends, and we created a mental health awareness campaign on social media. We used Figma to design posters, flyers, and landing pages, and then collaborated on a video script and production. We even made a fun dance challenge! It was so liberating to focus on a passion project outside of academia. I loved seeing the positive impact we had on our community, and it made me realize the power of design in telling important stories. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about using technology to improve healthcare outcomes! In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on developing an AI-powered, wearable medical device that can detect and predict various health conditions, particularly mental health disorders. This device would be integrated with a blockchain-based platform, ensuring data security and transparency. I envision creating a comprehensive ecosystem that links patients with doctors, researchers, and caregivers, promoting personalized treatment plans and informed decisions. It's a daunting challenge, but I'm eager to take on the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the medical field.
