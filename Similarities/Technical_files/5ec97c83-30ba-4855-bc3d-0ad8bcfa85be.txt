I've had a blast working on a personal project - a smart mirror that uses computer vision to analyze my skin and provide personalized skincare recommendations! I built the mirror using React Native and connected it to a flask backend for API interactions. It was my first time delving into computer vision, and it was a real challenge, but the outcome was totally worth it. I loved seeing the finished product come together and getting feedback from friends and family who used it. It was an amazing feeling knowing I created something that helped people! I'm thrilled to think about the future, especially when it comes to technology. In the next 10 years, I'm really excited to dive deeper into Computer Vision and its applications. My dream is to develop an AI-powered system that can empower visually impaired individuals by transforming visual information into an auditory or tactile format. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way they interact with the world, giving them greater independence and access to information. The prospect of making a meaningful impact on people's lives is what gets me going - and pushes me to continue innovating and pushing boundaries!
