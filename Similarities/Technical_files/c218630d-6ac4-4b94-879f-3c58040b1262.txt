I recently worked on a personal project to create a to-do list app using Flutter. I had no prior experience with mobile app development, but I wanted to challenge myself and learn a new skill. I loved designing the user interface, experimenting with different layouts, and seeing my app come to life. The most exciting part was learning about state management and navigating the challenges that came with it. It was a fun project that not only taught me a new skill but also helped me build confidence in my coding abilities. In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to be working on a mobile app that utilizes AI-powered robotics to empower visually impaired individuals. The app would use computer vision and machine learning to navigate and assist users in various settings, such as recognizing everyday objects, reading street signs, and identifying friends' faces. I'm passionate about making a positive impact on people's lives, and I believe that technology can be a game-changer. My ultimate goal is to make the app a standard assistive technology tool, helping to bridge the accessibility gap and foster greater inclusion for individuals with visual impairments.
