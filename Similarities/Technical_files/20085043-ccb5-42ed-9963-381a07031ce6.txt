I recently worked on a project that combined my love for design and tech - creating a mobile app using Flutter to help people track their mental health. It was a passion project, and I enjoyed the process of designing the UI/UX and then bringing it to life with coding. I used MongoDB to store user data and worked on the backend to implement authentication and personalized tracking features. Seeing the app come together was incredibly fulfilling, and I received amazing feedback from friends who used it. It was a blast to work on a project that combined both technical and non-technical skills! I'm thrilled to share that I'm really passionate about leveraging innovative technologies to create positive social impact. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to work on projects that combine AR/VR with healthcare to improve patient outcomes. For instance, I envision a future where people can use AR-glasses to visualize and interact with 3D models of their organs, allowing doctors to conduct more accurate diagnoses and surgeries. It's a ambitious goal, but I believe it's not only feasible but also desperately needed. The prospect of transforming lives through technology is what drives me every day.
