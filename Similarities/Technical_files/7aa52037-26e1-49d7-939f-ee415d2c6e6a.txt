I recently worked on a project where I built a virtual mental health assistant using computer vision and machine learning. The assistant used facial recognition to detect emotions and offer personalized self-care advice. I designed the interface using Figma and built the backend with Flask. Seeing my AI model learn and improve over time was super cool! This project allowed me to combine my passion for health, tech, and problem-solving. It was an awesome feeling to know that something I created could potentially make a positive impact on people's lives. It was a great challenge that forced me to learn new skills and work outside my comfort zone. I'm thrilled to dive into a project that combines my passion for healthcare and tech! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing AI-powered personalized medicine platforms that can help diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. By leveraging computer vision, machine learning, and IoT sensors, I envision a system that can monitor and analyze patients' vital signs, detect early signs of illnesses, and even prescribe customized treatments. This revolutionary platform could potentially save countless lives, and I'd be honored to be a part of it. It's a lofty goal, but I'm confident that together, we can make it a reality!
