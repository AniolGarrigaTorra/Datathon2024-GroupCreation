One project that really stood out to me was building an AI-powered virtual tour guide for visually impaired students using React, TensorFlow, and Computer Vision! I was part of a team that developed an AR-based system that could recognize and provide information about objects in their surroundings. Seeing the impact it had on the students was incredible - it was awesome to see them explore and learn in a new way. Plus, it was super fun collaborating with my team and getting creative with coding and problem-solving! I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastic about creating a revolutionary AI-powered language learning system that incorporates voice skills and AR/VR technology. Imagine being able to effortlessly converse with others in your target language, with a personalized learning experience tailored to your goals and learning style. The system would utilize computer vision to recognize hand gestures, facial expressions, and even body language to adapt its teaching methods. This ambitious project would enable anyone to become a polyglot and bridge the linguistic gap worldwide, breaking cultural barriers and fostering global understanding. It's a bold dream, but I'm ready to dive in!
