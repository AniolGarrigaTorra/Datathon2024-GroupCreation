I loved working on a personal project to develop a chatbot using JavaScript and Natural Language Processing. It was a huge learning curve, but I enjoyed the process of collecting data, designing the conversation flow, and implementing the AI algorithms. The most rewarding part was seeing my bot come to life and having real conversations with users. I even shared it on a subreddit and got great feedback from fellow bot enthusiasts! Working on this project not only improved my coding skills but also fueled my passion for robotics and AI, which is something I'd like to explore further at the datathon. What an exciting question! As a young enthusiast of technologies, I'm thrilled to think about the future. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing to help people with special needs or impairments communicate more efficiently. Imagine a world where everyone has access to equal opportunities, and AI acts as a bridge to bridge that gap. My dream is to collaborate with experts in this field and combine my skills in computer vision, PyTorch, and UI/UX design to create a groundbreaking platform that empowers inclusivity.
