One project that really stands out to me is a music recommendation system I built using machine learning and Python. I've always loved music and was fascinated by the idea of creating a system that could recommend songs based on a user's preferences. I gathered a dataset of songs and their features, trained a model using scikit-learn, and deployed it on a simple web app. It was amazing to see how accurately it could predict user preferences and introduce them to new artists and songs! Working on this project really honed my skills in machine learning and problem-solving, and I had a blast doing it. I'm absolutely thrilled to think about the impact I'd love to make in the next decade. One thing I'm really passionate about is developing a more intuitive and accessible AI-powered music composition tool. Imagine being able to create complex melodies and harmonies with the simplicity of a smartphone app! As someone who's a musician at heart, I envision an AI co-creation partner that understands artistic vision and complements human creativity. I'd love to join forces with a talented team to bring this concept to life, and I believe the datathon will give me the necessary skills and network to take the first steps towards making this dream a reality.
