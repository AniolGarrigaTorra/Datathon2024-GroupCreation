I worked on a project to create an AI-powered chatbot using Rust and React, aimed at helping students with their academic queries. I designed the user interface and implemented the AI backend using Rust. It was really fulfilling to see my creation help students and get positive feedback! The project helped me learn about natural language processing and improve my React skills. What I enjoyed most was the opportunity to apply my knowledge to a tangible problem and share it with my peers. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about making education more accessible and engaging through the integration of AR/VR technology. I envision creating an immersive learning platform that not only entertains but also personalizes and accelerates the learning process. Imagine being able to explore historical sites, interact with 3D models, or participate in simulated labs, making learning more enjoyable and effective. With my background in UI/UX design and programming skills in Rust, I'm eager to dive into this realm and push the boundaries of what's possible. The prospect of transforming the educational landscape excites me to no end!
