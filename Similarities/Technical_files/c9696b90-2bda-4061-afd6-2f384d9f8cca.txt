I'd say one of my favorite projects is a music festival app I built with React Native. It was a passion project that allowed me to combine my love for music and design. I designed the UI/UX, built the app from scratch, and even integrated a playlist feature using Spotify's API. It was amazing to see it come together and receive feedback from friends and fellow music lovers. The experience taught me a lot about building a complex app from scratch and handling API integrations. It's still one of the projects I'm most proud of! As I sit here, thinking about the next decade, I get goosebumps just imagining the possibilities! I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing innovative projects that merge my passions for design, art, and gaming. My dream is to create a virtual reality platform that uses machine learning algorithms to generate art and music based on users' emotions and mental states. The platform would be designed to provide a holistic, immersive experience that enables individuals to explore and express themselves in ways we haven't seen before. It's a bold endeavor, but I'm up for the challenge!
