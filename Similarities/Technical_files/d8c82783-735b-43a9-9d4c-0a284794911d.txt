I had a blast working on a personal project to build a chatbot for my university's student organization. I used JavaScript and React to create the bot, and designed its interface to be super intuitive and user-friendly. I even experimented with blockchain to enable secure logging of conversation histories. Seeing the bot come to life and hearing feedback from my peers was so rewarding! It was a non-technical project, but it allowed me to flex my problem-solving skills and bring together my interests in communication and design. It was an awesome feeling knowing I was creating something that could genuinely help my community. What an exciting thought! In the next 10 years, I'm passionate about collaborating on projects that merge the realms of blockchain, IoT, and communication. Imagine a world where healthcare data is securely stored and shared across decentralized networks, empowering patients to take control of their medical histories. I envision designing innovative wearables and mobile apps that enable seamless interactions with this blockchain-based ecosystem. With the rapid advancements in voice AI, I'd love to integrate intuitive voice commands to simplify data input and access. The possibilities are endless, and I'm thrilled to be a part of shaping this future.
