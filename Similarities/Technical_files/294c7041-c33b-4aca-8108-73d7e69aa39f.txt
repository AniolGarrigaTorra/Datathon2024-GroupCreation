I had a blast working on a machine learning project with my friends where we trained a deep learning model to classify cat breeds from images! We used TensorFlow and Python to build the model, and I was responsible for designing the Convolutional Neural Network architecture. It was awesome to see our model achieve an accuracy of 92% on a test dataset! We even created a funny interactive demo where users could upload their own cat photos and see which breed their cat might be. Working on this project taught me a lot about the challenges and joys of working with large datasets and model selection. What a thrilling question! As a third-year student, I'm still finding my footing in the world of tech, but the prospect of exploring the quantum computing frontier keeps me up at night (mostly because I'm too excited to sleep). Within the next decade, I envision working on developing more efficient and scalable solutions for quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure communication in an increasingly connected world. I'm already enthralled by the vast potential of quantum computing's ability to revolutionize data transmission and authentication. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll be part of the team that cracking the secrets of quantum codes!
