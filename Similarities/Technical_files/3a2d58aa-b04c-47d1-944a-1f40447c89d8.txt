I recently worked on a React Native project, creating a Habit Tracker app for my friends who struggle to stay on top of their daily routines. I loved building a product that could actually make a positive impact on people's lives! I got to implement features like habit statistics, customizable widgets, and integrations with calendar reminders. Seeing the finished product come together was incredibly rewarding. I also learned a ton about building a maintainable app with a clean architecture. It was an amazing feeling knowing that I created something that I would actually use myself (and so would my friends!) I'm really passionate about using technology to drive social good, and in the next 10 years, I'd love to contribute to developing affordable, accessible smart homes for low-income families. I've had exposure to IoT projects, and I believe that smart homes can revolutionize the way people live, especially for those who struggle with accessibility issues. Imagine being able to control your lighting, temperature, and security with ease, without breaking the bank. I'd love to work on a project that bridges this gap, incorporating AI and DevOps to make smart homes a reality for all.
