I recently built an AR game for Android using React Native and Python for machine learning-powered obstacle detection. I was blown away by how quickly React Native allowed me to deploy my app on multiple platforms, and the machine learning aspect was a huge challenge that pushed me to learn a lot! The project was a blast to work on, and I loved seeing it come to life. Even though I made some rookie mistakes, I gained a ton of confidence in my ability to integrate multiple technologies and tackle complex problems. Can't wait to apply those skills to this datathon! What gets me pumped is the prospect of blending AR/VR with machine learning to create life-like simulations that revolutionize education, training, and even healthcare. Imagine being able to practice surgery on a virtual patient, or learning a new language in a fully immersive environment. With my skills in programming and data analysis, I'd love to contribute to this endeavor. In the next 10 years, I envision using augmented reality to create personalized training programs that accelerate knowledge retention and retention. It's a challenging and ambitious goal, but I believe it's a crucial step towards a more equitable and accessible learning landscape.
