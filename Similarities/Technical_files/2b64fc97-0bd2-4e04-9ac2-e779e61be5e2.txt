I really loved working on a non-technical project I titled Echoes, where I explored music production through beats and sound design. It was my way to unwind and express my creativity. I used a digital audio workstation to create and arrange melodies, experimenting with different genres and techniques. What I enjoyed most was seeing a song come to life and hearing people's reactions when I shared it with friends. It helped me appreciate the importance of collaboration and how technical skills can be used to tell emotional stories through art. I'm thrilled to think about the future, especially when it comes to the intersection of technology and human wellness. In the next 10 years, I envision working on developing AI-powered platforms that can help analyze and predict patient outcomes in healthcare. As a triple threat (engineering, computer vision, and ML expert), I'd love to contribute to creating intelligent systems that aid doctors and researchers in identifying high-risk patients, spotting early signs of chronic diseases, and streamlining patient care. The idea of using technology to improve the human condition is what gets me pumped, and I hope to play a role in making that a reality!
