I had an amazing time working on a personal project - a mobile app that helps people find their lost pets in the neighborhood. As an Android Dev, I created an app that allows users to report their lost pets and surrounding people to receive notifications to keep an eye out for them. It was awesome seeing how I could use my skills to make a real difference in people's lives! The best part was when I received feedback from a user whose pet was reunited thanks to my app - it was an incredible feeling! As a young and ambitious student in the field of computer science, I'm thrilled to think about the exciting projects I'll have the opportunity to work on in the next 10 years. One area that really excites me is the intersection of AI and Blockchain. Imagine a future where decentralized AI algorithms power secure and transparent social networks, ensuring that users' personal data is protected and respected. I'd love to be part of a team that develops these systems and works towards creating a more equitable and responsible online environment. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to get started!
