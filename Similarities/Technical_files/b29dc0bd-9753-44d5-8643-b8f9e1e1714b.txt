One of my favorite projects I've worked on is a social media scheduling tool I created using React Native and a PostgreSQL database. The idea was born from my own struggles in keeping track of posting updates across multiple platforms, and I wanted to make it easier for others to do so too. I loved designing the user interface and implementing features like automated post scheduling and social media monitoring. Seeing the tool come to life and knowing it could make a difference in people's workflow was super fulfilling! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next decade, I'd love to contribute to developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between people and technology. Specifically, I'm passionate about using data and programming to create AI-powered tools that amplify marginalized voices and address social injustices. Imagine a world where chatbots and virtual assistants empower marginalized communities to access crucial resources, support, and educational opportunities. It's a daunting task, but I believe that with dedication and collaboration, we can harness technology to create positive change and create a more equitable world.
