I loved working on a project where I built an augmented reality scavenger hunt app for an educational hackathon. I got to combine my interests in education, AR/VR, and mobile development to create an immersive experience for kids to learn about different species. I used TensorFlow for object recognition, React Native for the frontend, and Flutter for the backend. Seeing kids' faces light up when they found the virtual creatures in the park was incredibly rewarding. It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to learn new skills and make a positive impact, which was an amazing feeling! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of immersive technologies that can revolutionize the way we learn and interact. As someone who's fascinated by AR/VR, Machine Learning, and Education, I envision a world where interactive, AI-powered simulations become a cornerstone of our educational system. Imagine being able to explore ancient civilizations, witness historical events, or practice complex surgeries all from the comfort of your own home. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to be a part of shaping this exciting future!
