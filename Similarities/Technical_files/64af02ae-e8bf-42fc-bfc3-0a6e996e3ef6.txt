One project that really stood out to me was creating a digital calendar for a local community center. It was a non-technical project, but it required some programming knowledge, especially in terms of understanding the backend. I designed the interface using Figma, made sure it was user-friendly, and built the calendar using JavaScript. It was amazing to see how something I created could help people stay organized and make their lives easier. Plus, getting to talk to the community members and learn about their needs was an incredible experience. It was a great blend of tech and social good! I'm super pumped about the prospect of working on a project that combines my passion for health, social good, and machine learning to develop an AI-powered patient navigation system for underserved communities. I envision a platform that utilizes natural language processing to analyze a patient's medical history, medications, and lifestyle to provide personalized treatment plans and connect them with specialized healthcare providers. It's an opportunity to leverage my skills in programming and design to make a meaningful impact on people's lives and contribute to bridging healthcare inequalities. It's a daunting but exciting challenge ahead!
