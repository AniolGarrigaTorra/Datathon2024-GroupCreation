I had a blast working on a personal project called EcoPulse - a simple mobile app that tracks and compares your daily environmental impact. Using React Native, I designed a user-friendly interface to log daily habits, like energy consumption and transportation choices. I linked it to a MongoDB database to store and analyze user data. Seeing users engage with the app, sharing tips, and encouraging each other to make eco-friendly choices was incredibly rewarding. It's amazing how a project can evolve from an idea to a functional tool that inspires positive change. That experience fuels my passion for development! As a student of computer science, I'm thrilled to think about the potential applications of emerging technologies. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing artificial intelligence systems that can augment human cognition, enabling people with neurological disorders or physical limitations to interact with the world more effectively. I envision creating a wearable device that translates neural signals into commands, allowing individuals to type messages, control prosthetics, or even drive vehicles with their minds. This technology has the potential to revolutionize lives and create new possibilities for those who face barriers in their daily lives.
