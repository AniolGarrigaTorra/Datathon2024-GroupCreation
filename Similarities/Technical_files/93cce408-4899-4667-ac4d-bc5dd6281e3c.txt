I loved working on a React Native project where I built a social media app for a fictional band. It was a non-technical challenge that combined my passion for music and art with my programming skills. I got to design the app's UI, implement features like posting updates and commenting, and even created a simple analytics dashboard. It was a great opportunity to experiment with React Native and think creatively about how to translate my design ideas into functional code. As a student and a programmer, I've always been fascinated by the idea of developing intelligent systems that can positively impact our daily lives. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on a project that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a personalized wellness platform for people living with disabilities. This platform would utilize natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics to provide tailored advice, assistive technologies, and emotional support. I envision a future where individuals with disabilities can live independently and confidently, with technology at their side to empower them to achieve their goals.
