One project I really enjoyed working on was building a voice-powered recipe assistant using Python and Flask. I've always loved cooking and experimenting with new recipes, but I was tired of switching between recipe websites and apps to find the next dish to try. So, I decided to create a simple assistant that could suggest recipes based on dietary preferences and ingredients I had on hand. It was a great opportunity to apply my machine learning knowledge to a practical problem and ended up being a lot of fun to develop! What a thrilling question! As a fintech enthusiast, I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions to bridge the financial inclusion gap globally. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on designing and deploying AI-powered mobile apps that empower low-income communities, particularly in developing regions, to securely manage their finances, access vital services, and break the cycle of poverty. This vision aligns with my fascination for using tech to drive positive social impact, and I'd be thrilled to collaborate with experts from various fields to bring this ambitious idea to life.
