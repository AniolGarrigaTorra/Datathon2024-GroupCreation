I worked on a non-technical project - a lifehacks blog where I shared my favorite tips and tricks for staying organized and productive! I loved creating step-by-step tutorials, testing my ideas, and getting feedback from friends and family. It was amazing to see how it brought people together, and some folks even implemented my suggestions and saw real changes in their daily lives. I enjoyed the creative freedom of choosing the topics and creating the content - it's a far cry from programming, but I had so much fun experimenting and growing with it! I'm thrilled to envision a future where technology empowers education to bridge the global skills gap. In the next 10 years, I'd love to see innovative AR/VR applications designed to immerse students in experiential learning experiences. As a DevOps enthusiast, I'd work on developing blockchain-based platforms to securely store and track educational credentials, skills certifications, and personal achievements. My ultimate dream is to create a decentralized, blockchain-enabled, AI-driven e-learning ecosystem that connects students worldwide, enables flexible, gamified learning pathways, and helps measure and validate lifelong learning journeys.
