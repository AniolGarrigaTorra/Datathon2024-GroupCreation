I loved working on a personal project where I designed and developed a simple web game using TypeScript and Figma. It was a puzzle game where players had to navigate a grid to collect all the elements while avoiding obstacles. I enjoyed the process of bringing my design vision to life, experimenting with different graphics and animations, and problem-solving as I coded. Seeing the game come together was an amazing feeling, and it was a great opportunity for me to apply my programming skills in a creative way. It's a great feeling to see your code come to life and entertain others! I'm thrilled to think about the future, and in the next 10 years, I'm eager to delve into quantum computing! The thought of leveraging machine learning algorithms to navigate the intricacies of quantum systems and solving complex problems is truly exciting. I envision myself contributing to breakthroughs in fields like medical research, environmental sustainability, and cryptography. It's incredible to consider the potential for accelerating scientific discoveries and improving people's lives. By then, I aim to have honed my skills and knowledge to play a part in shaping this revolutionary technology's trajectory. It's both intimidating and exhilarating!
