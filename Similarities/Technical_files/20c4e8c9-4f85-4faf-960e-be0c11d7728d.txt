Oh, hands down, it's gotta be my AR/VR project from last semester's class! We had to create an augmented reality game using A-Frame and GitHub, and it was SO much fun! I got to bring my love of gaming and creativity to life. I designed and built a 3D puzzle game where players had to use their phones to navigate a mini-game. Seeing my classmates' amazement when they tried it out for the first time was the best! It was super fulfilling to combine tech and imagination. As a huge fan of Cybersecurity, I've always been fascinated by the concept of developing AI-powered secure virtual realities that can transform the way we interact with information. I dream of creating a platform that utilizes blockchain and DevOps to create secure and immersive AR/VR experiences, enabling users to access critical information and make informed decisions in a safe and controlled environment. With the rise of gaming and interactive entertainment, I believe this technology has the potential to revolutionize industries and transform the way we consume information. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
