I've always loved working on projects that combine my interests in Health and Technology! One of my favorite projects was a virtual reality prototype I built for a hackathon, aiming to help people with anxiety disorders relax. I collaborated with a design partner to create a calming ocean simulation, and we used React and Machine Learning to incorporate real-time heartbeat tracking and guided meditation. Seeing people react to it and hearing their positive feedback was incredibly rewarding. I'm thrilled to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the next 10 years, I'm extremely excited to work on developing AI-powered learning platforms that cater to special needs children. As someone who's passionate about education and Quantum computing, I envision creating a revolutionary platform that uses quantum machines to improve learning outcomes for kids with autism, ADHD, and other neurodiverse conditions. By leveraging Machine Learning, IoT sensors, and Blockchain technology, we could provide personalized education, real-time assessments, and remote monitoring to ensure every child reaches their full potential. The prospect of making a tangible difference in their lives gets me pumped!
