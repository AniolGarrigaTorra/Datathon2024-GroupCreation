Man, I had so much fun working on this project! I created a personal project using Flutter to help my aunt manage her finances. I built a simple budgeting app that allowed her to track her expenses and set reminders for bill payments. I used AWS to host the backend and PyTorch for data analysis to identify trends in her spending habits. It was amazing to see my aunt use the app and hear how it made her life easier. That project was like a breath of fresh air for me - I learned so much and got to help someone I care about! As I'm looking ahead, I'm super stoked about the possibility of developing a conversational AI that can effectively assist people with disabilities. I'm passionate about harnessing the power of voice recognition and natural language processing to create a seamless and inclusive communication experience. Imagine being able to simply think or talk, and your thoughts being translated into written or spoken language, enabling effortless interaction with the world. It's a futuristic concept that gets me pumped, and I'd love to collaborate with fellow innovators to make it a reality. The potential to change lives through coding is exhilarating!
