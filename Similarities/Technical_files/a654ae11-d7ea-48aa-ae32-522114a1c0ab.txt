I had a blast working on my final project in mobile development where I built an AR game using PyTorch and Android. It was an incredible experience combining my love for design, coding, and gaming. I created a spooky 3D maze that uses AR to superimpose itself over the player's surroundings. The best part? I got to see my friends and family trying it out and freaking out when they realized they were surrounded by a mysterious ancient temple! Who knew developing an AR game could be so much fun? As I gaze into the future, I envision myself working on a revolutionary AR/VR project that transforms the education landscape. Imagine a world where students can step into immersive virtual labs, interactive museum exhibits, or real-time language exchange environments, bridging the gap between theory and practice. I'd love to develop a platform that uses AI-driven adaptability, gamification, and augmented reality to create a personalized learning experience. The future of education holds endless possibilities, and I'm stoked to be a part of shaping it. The next 10 years, here I come!
