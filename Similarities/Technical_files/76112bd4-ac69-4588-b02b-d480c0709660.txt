I had a blast working on a school project where I used JavaScript to build a game, literally! It was called Game Quest, and it was a role-playing game where players could choose their own adventures and explore virtual worlds. I designed the graphics, coded the game mechanics, and even made a simple AI system for the NPCs. I loved seeing the project come to life and playing it with my friends during lunch breaks. It was an amazing experience, and I'm hoping to incorporate more game dev ideas into my datathon projects! I'm thrilled to envision a future where my passion for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) converges with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). In the next 10 years, I aim to contribute to the development of autonomous systems that empower people with disabilities, facilitating their independence and equal participation in society. Imagine machines that can recognize and assist individuals with varying impairments, providing personalized support and empowerment. As a developer, I look forward to crafting innovative solutions that blur the lines between technology and social good, creating a more inclusive and compassionate world for all.
