I've always been fascinated by music and technology, so I built a project that combines both - a virtual guitar tuner app for iOS. Using Swift and Core Audio, I created an app that listens to your guitar playing and gives you instant feedback on pitch and timing. It was so satisfying to see something I created come to life and help fellow musicians tune their instruments more easily. I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to work on developing an augmented reality platform that enables people with disabilities to navigate and interact with their surroundings more effortlessly. Imagine being able to recognize and respond to hand gestures, or receive real-time audio descriptions of your environment. I'd love to merge my passions for AR/VR, design, and accessibility to create a revolutionary solution that breaks down barriers and opens up new possibilities for people worldwide. It's a daunting task, but the prospect of making a meaningful impact drives me!
