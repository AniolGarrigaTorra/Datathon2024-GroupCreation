I've had a blast working on my own project, a text-based adventure game using HTML/CSS and React! I created a choose-your-own-adventure style game, where the player can explore a fantasy world, interact with characters, and solve puzzles. I loved designing the game's aesthetic, creating 3D-like environments with CSS, and implementing the story branches using React components. I even added a AI-powered NPC that responds to player actions, making it feel more immersive. It was a great way to exercise my creativity and problem-solving skills. I learned a ton and can't wait to work on another project like it! As a student fascinated by technology and innovation, I'm thrilled to envision myself making a significant impact in the fintech industry. I dream of developing AI-powered financial analytics tools that help individuals make more informed investment decisions, streamline financial transactions, and alleviate the workload of financial professionals. I imagine myself working with top fintech companies, collaborating with world-class teams, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning and cloud computing. With dedication and hard work, I'm confident that my passion for coding and fascination with fintech will lead to remarkable innovations in the years to come.
