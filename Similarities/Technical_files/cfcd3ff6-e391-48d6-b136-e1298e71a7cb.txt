I recently worked on a non-technical project that I absolutely loved - building a harmonica-themed journal. I combined my love of music and art to create a unique and personalized journal for harmonica enthusiasts. I designed the cover art, wrote prompts, and curated song lyrics and quotes to inspire creative expression. It was a blast to research, design, and put together a product that brought joy to others. It's a small but satisfying project that allowed me to explore my creative side and think outside of coding challenges. It's a great reminder that tech and creativity can blend together beautifully! What a thrilling thought experiment! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive into the world of Audio AI, specifically Voice AI. With advancements in machine learning and audio processing, I envision creating intelligent assistants that can understand and mimic human-like conversations, music improvisations, or even art critiques. Imagine conversing with a knowledgeable AI that not only understands what you say but also recognizes the emotions behind it, allowing for a truly empathetic connection. I hope to play a part in shaping this future, blending tech, creativity, and human connection. It's an exciting thought, and I'm hooked!
