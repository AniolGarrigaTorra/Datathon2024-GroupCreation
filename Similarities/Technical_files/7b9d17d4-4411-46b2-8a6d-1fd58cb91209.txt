I recently worked on a non-technical project, creating a music video for my school's talent show. I've always loved music and art, and this project allowed me to combine those passions. I designed the visuals, including animation and graphics, to accompany a local singer's performance. It was such a blast working on a creative project that wasn't coding-focused! I even got to experiment with sound design and editing. Seeing the finished product on stage was an amazing feeling. Who knew making a music video could be just as fulfilling as building a machine learning model? I'm absolutely thrilled to share that I'm passion-driven to make a meaningful impact in the field of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good. In the next 10 years, I envision leveraging my programming skills in machine learning and computer vision to develop intelligent systems that empower non-profit organizations to optimize their social programs and services. Imagine AI-powered solutions that can analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and generate insights to make more informed decisions, ultimately amplifying their social impact. It's a lofty goal, but I believe it's a crucial step towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
