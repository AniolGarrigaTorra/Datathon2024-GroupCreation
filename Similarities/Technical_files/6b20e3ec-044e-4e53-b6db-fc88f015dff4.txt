Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share this with you! In my free time, I worked on a project that's really close to my heart - a podcast that showcases up-and-coming talent in the voice over industry! I created the website and logo using HTML/CSS, and also set up the podcast hosting and analytics using PostgreSQL. It was a non-technical project, but it was so much fun experimenting with different layouts and designing an aesthetically pleasing website. I even got to collaborate with friends and connect with up-and-coming voice over artists - it was an amazing experience that combined my love for communication and voice skills! I'm beyond thrilled to share my dream project! In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on creating an AI-powered mobile app that helps bridge the communication gap between people with speech disabilities and their loved ones. The app, named VocalTie, would use natural language processing and computer vision to translate sign language or other forms of communication into spoken language, enabling seamless interactions. It's a project that resonates with me deeply, as I'm passionate about voice skills and its potential to empower individuals. I hope to be working on VocalTie full-time and making a positive impact on people's lives.
