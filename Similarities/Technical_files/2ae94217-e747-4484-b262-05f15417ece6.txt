I had a blast working on a pet project, called Smart Gardener! It was a robotic process automation system that helped monitor and maintain my friend's indoor plants. Using computer vision and IoT, I created a smart gardening system that identified the plant species, tracked its growth, and detected any water leaks or over-watering. I even integrated a Flutter app for easy control and monitoring. It was a great opportunity to combine my passions for robotics, web development, and AI. It's been really fulfilling to see the impact it's had on my friend's green thumb adventure! I'm really excited to work on developing artificial intelligence that has a significant impact on educational institutions. With AI, it's possible to create more personalized learning experiences for students, helping them learn more effectively and efficiently. I'd love to work on a project that integrates AI with augmented reality and robotic process automation to create interactive educational materials that are both fun and engaging. Imagine a system where AI-powered chatbots can detect a student's knowledge gaps and provide instant feedback, while AR-enhanced textbooks bring complex concepts to life in 3D. It's a dream of making learning more accessible and enjoyable for everyone!
