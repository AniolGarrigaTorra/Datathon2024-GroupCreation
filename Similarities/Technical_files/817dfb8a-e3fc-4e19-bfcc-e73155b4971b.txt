I'd say one of my favorite projects was creating a simple AR application using AR.js and JavaScript to visualize 3D models of historical buildings. I've always been fascinated by history, so this project allowed me to combine my passion for education and AR/VR. I designed an immersive experience that let users see how ancient civilizations built their structures. The project was a challenge, but it was super rewarding to see it come to life! The combination of technology and history made it a unique and engaging experience. I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing innovative, personalized learning platforms that leverage augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we approach education. Imagine being able to interact with 3D simulations, participate in virtual field trips, and track progress in a decentralized, tamper-proof environment. I envision students being empowered to take ownership of their learning journey, with access to real-time feedback, personalized curricula, and mentorship opportunities. The potential for impact is staggering, and I'd love to be part of a team that helps shape the future of education in a meaningful, disruptive way.
