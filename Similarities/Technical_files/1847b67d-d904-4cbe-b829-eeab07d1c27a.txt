I'm super excited to talk about my capstone project in school, where I built a web-based platform for a local pet store. I used React Native to create a user-friendly app for customers to book pet vaccinations and grooming services. I also designed the UI/UX to ensure a seamless experience for both customers and staff. It was a challenge balancing my programming skills with designing an intuitive interface, but the sense of accomplishment was incredible! It's amazing how tech can bring joy to people's lives, and this project really put that into perspective for me. I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing intelligent patient-facing interfaces that utilize AI and AR/VR technologies to revolutionize healthcare experiences! As someone fascinated by both technology and medicine, I envision a future where patients can receive personalized care through intuitive, interactive platforms that empower them to take a more active role in their own well-being. Imagine being able to monitor vital signs, track health metrics, and access condition-specific advice all within an immersive, virtual environment. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm convinced that harnessing the power of data and technology can significantly improve patient outcomes and healthcare overall.
