I'm really passionate about productivity and time management, so I created a digital planner app called Ryder's Agenda. I designed the UI and developed the app using Swift for iOS. I used MongoDB as the backend and Python for some data processing. It was an amazing experience to work on a project that I knew people would actually use and benefit from. Plus, I love tinkering with apps, so it was a blast coding and troubleshooting. The app has a simple, user-friendly design and a lot of cool features like reminders and scheduling. I even sold a few copies, which was a great feeling! What gets me excited is the prospect of developing an AI-powered, blockchain-based healthcare platform that seamlessly integrates patient records, medical research, and personalized wellness guidance. I envision a decentralized ecosystem where individuals can securely store and manage their medical data, and receive curated recommendations based on cutting-edge research and their unique genetic profile. This vision combines my passions for healthcare, technology, and data analysis, allowing me to make a tangible impact on people's lives. The thought of pioneering such a system keeps me up at night, driving me to stay focused and keep learning!
