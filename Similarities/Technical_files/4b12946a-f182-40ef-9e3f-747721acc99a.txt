Ah, yeah! I had so much fun working on a personal project, where I built a simple AR-based mobile game for iOS using React Native. I'm a huge gamer, and I always wanted to create something like Pok√©mon Go, but more retro-style and low-key. It was amazing to see my ideas come to life, experimenting with ARKit, and figuring out how to optimize the performance. Even though it's not a commercial hit, it was incredible to see people I know play and appreciate it. Non-tech friends were like, 'WHOA, how did you do that?' I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionately eager to dive into the realm of Metaverse development, where technology and imagination converge. Imagine being able to build immersive experiences, interact with virtual beings, and collaborate on projects in a digital universe that's just as vibrant as the physical one. With my background in UI/UX design and experience with programming languages like Rust and Go, I'm excited to contribute to the next wave of innovations in this space. The possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to be part of the adventure that's shaping the future of virtual reality!
