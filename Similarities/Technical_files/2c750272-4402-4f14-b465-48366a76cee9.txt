I loved working on a personal project to create a smart speaker system for my dorm room using a Raspberry Pi, IoT modules, and Docker containers. I designed the system to integrate with Spotify and voice recognition using Go. It was thrilling to see my creation come together! Not only did I learn about machine learning, but I also explored IoT hardware and containerization. The best part was setting up the system and being able to give voice commands to change my favorite songs. I'm thrilled to envision a future where I contribute to the development of AI-powered, personalized retail experiences that seamlessly merge physical and digital spaces. Imagine walking into a store, and being greeted with a virtual assistant that not only acknowledges your preferences but also adapts the entire shopping environment to cater to your mood and style. I'd love to work on designing an integrated ecosystem that blends machine learning, IoT, and UX design to revolutionize the way we interact with products and services. It's a tantalizing prospect, and one that gets me energized about the boundless possibilities!
