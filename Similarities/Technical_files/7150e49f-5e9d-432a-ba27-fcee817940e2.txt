I recently worked on a personal project that allowed me to combine two of my passions - music and art. I used machine learning to create an algorithm that analyzed the user's music preferences and generated a unique art piece based on their musical taste. I used TensorFlow for the ML model and paired it with Go to build the backend. The frontend was a simple iOS app that allowed users to input their favorite artists and generate a visual representation of their music preference. It was an amazing experience to see how I could merge technical skills with creative passions and create something so unique! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about developing an AI-powered, non-invasive, and wearable medical device that can monitor and analyze a person's vital signs and health metrics in real-time. Envision a wristband that uses computer vision and sensor data to detect early signs of chronic diseases, like diabetes or cardiac arrest. The device would provide personalized health insights and predictive alerts to medical professionals and patients alike, ultimately revolutionizing preventative care and potentially saving countless lives. I'm driven by the prospect of making a tangible impact on global health and wellness in the years to come.
