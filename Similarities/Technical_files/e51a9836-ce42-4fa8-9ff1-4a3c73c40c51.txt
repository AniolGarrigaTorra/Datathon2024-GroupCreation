One project I really enjoyed working on was building a mobile game using Flutter. I'd always been a fan of mobile games, so it was awesome to create one myself! I chose to develop a match-3 puzzle game with cute cartoon characters. I learned a lot about game development, like designing game mechanics, writing AI algorithms, and optimizing performance. It was great to see my idea come to life and playtesting with friends was so much fun! Even though it's not perfect, I'm really proud of what I accomplished and it's still one of my favorite projects to this day. I'm thrilled to share that I'm excited to contribute to the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage blockchain technology to empower social good initiatives. I envision working on projects that combine data analysis, machine learning, and innovative interfaces to promote accessibility, education, and economic opportunities for underprivileged communities. With the expertise gained from this datathon, I hope to become a key member of a team that develops a dApp that connects marginalized groups to valuable resources, enabling them to take control of their lives and shape their own futures.
