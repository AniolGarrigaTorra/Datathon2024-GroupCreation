I recently built a chatbot for my university's student council, using Google Cloud's Dialogflow and a dash of Python programming. I wanted to create a bot that could help students with general queries, such as club information and campus events. I had a blast designing the conversational flow and implementing it with UI/UX principles in mind. Seeing it come together was incredibly rewarding, and it's been a huge hit with students. I loved combining my interests in Voice skills and Mobile development, and I'm excited to learn more about how AI can be used to create innovative solutions! I'm thrilled to think about the next decade! In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a team that's developing an AI-powered chatbot that integrates voice skills with physical devices, enhancing the way we interact with technology. Imagine being able to control smart homes, access vital information, or even conduct daily tasks just by speaking to a device. I believe combining my passions for Voice skills, DevOps, and Mobile would enable me to contribute to shaping the future of voice interface development. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm excited to learn and grow towards making it a reality.
