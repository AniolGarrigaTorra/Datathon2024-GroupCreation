Ooh, I'm so excited to share! I created a life hack dashboard using Flask and PostgreSQL to track my daily habits and to-do lists. It was an awesome feeling to combine my love for lifehacks and tech to create something practical and fun. The dashboard shows me which tasks I need to complete, and even gives me rewards and notifications when I hit certain milestones. It's been super useful in staying on top of my college life, and it's given me a huge sense of accomplishment knowing I built it myself. I'm thrilled to share my aspirations with you! In the next 10 years, I envision working on a project that integrates my passions for social good, technology, and lifehacks. I dream of developing a mobile app that helps underserved communities access essential resources and services, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency and trust. The app would facilitate access to education, healthcare, and financial services, empowering individuals to break cycles of poverty. I'd collaborate with NGOs, developers, and stakeholders to create a platform that's both user-friendly and scalable, making a tangible impact on the lives of millions.
