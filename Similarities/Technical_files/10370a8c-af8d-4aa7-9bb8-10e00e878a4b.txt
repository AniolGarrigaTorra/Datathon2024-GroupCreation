I really enjoyed working on a UI/UX design project for a mobile app that helps students stay organized and focused. As a student myself, I related to the struggles of balancing schoolwork and extracurriculars, so I was excited to help create a tool that could make a difference. I used Figma to design the user interface, and I loved seeing my ideas come to life. It was my first time creating a comprehensive design, so it was a great learning experience. I even got to test out my design skills by building a rough prototype on Android Studio - it was so cool to see it all come together! As an 18-year-old with a growing passion for tech and social good, I'm excited to tackle one of my biggest dreams - developing AI-powered platforms that address mental health disparities globally. I envision creating virtual reality experiences that combine immersive storytelling with personalized therapy sessions, accessible on affordable, open-source mobile devices. This innovative tech could help break down stigmas and provide vulnerable communities with crucial support. By combining data analysis, machine learning, and user-centered design, I aim to bridge the digital gap and make a meaningful impact on the lives of others. It's a lofty goal, but I'm ready to take on the challenge!
