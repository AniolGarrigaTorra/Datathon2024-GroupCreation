I had a blast creating a Spotify playlist generator web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm a music lover, so it was amazing to combine my two passions - music and coding! I designed the UI to look like a Spotify dashboard, and programmed it to generate playlists based on genres and moods. It was a fun challenge to work with APIs and user input to get the recommendations just right. Seeing it come together and getting feedback from friends has made it a super fulfilling project. Can't wait to work on more coding projects that combine art and tech! I'm thrilled to think about the kind of impact I can make in the next decade. As a creative problem solver, I'm excited to be a part of innovative projects that bring people and technology together. I envision myself working on augmented reality art installations that enable people to express themselves in new and immersive ways. I dream of collaborating with fellow artists and coders to create interactive stories and experiences that foster empathy, self-discovery, and community building. I'm eager to explore the intersection of art, technology, and society, and to be a catalyst for positive change.
