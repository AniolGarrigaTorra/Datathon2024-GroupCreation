One project that stands out to me is a game I built with a friend, where we used React Native to create a turn-based multiplayer game. We designed a futuristic arena where players could battle each other using different units and abilities. It was my first foray into game development, and I loved how quickly we could prototype and iterate on new features. I really enjoyed the challenge of balancing game mechanics and user experience. Plus, seeing the game come together and playing it with my friends was an amazing feeling! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! As someone who's always been fascinated by the intersection of gaming and databases, I'm stoked about the prospect of creating a innovative, location-based mobile game that utilizes augmented reality (AR) and machine learning (ML) to transport players into immersive, gamified experiences. Imagine being able to explore real-world environments, complete with interactive challenges and virtual NPCs, using your phone or AR glasses. The idea is to use computer vision, Android development, and ML to revolutionize mobile gaming, making it more engaging, social, and rewarding. It's a daunting but incredibly exciting challenge!
