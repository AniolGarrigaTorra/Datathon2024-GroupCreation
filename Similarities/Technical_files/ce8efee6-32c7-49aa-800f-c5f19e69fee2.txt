I've always been fascinated by the potential of virtual and augmented reality. In my spare time, I built an AR gaming app using Python and Android Development. I designed and developed a simple puzzle game where players navigate through a fantasy world, solving challenges to collect treasure. I enjoyed experimenting with the Unity game engine and the Java-based Google ARCore library. Seeing the app come to life was an incredible feeling! I learned a ton about 3D modeling, game development, and augmented reality, and I'm excited to share this passion project with fellow data enthusiasts during the datathon! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about using technology to reshape the education landscape. Within the next decade, I envision developing an AI-powered, immersive learning platform that revolutionizes the way students absorb and retain knowledge. Imagine interactive, gamified modules that cater to diverse learning styles, enabling individuals to upskill and reskill with unprecedented flexibility. I'd love to collaborate with educators, psychologists, and innovators to create a platform that's both engaging and effective. This future endeavor excites me because I believe it has the potential to democratize access to high-quality education and empower global communities.
