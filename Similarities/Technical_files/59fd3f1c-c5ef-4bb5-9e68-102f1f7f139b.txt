I had an absolute blast working on aReact Native app for a local music school! As a music lover myself, I was stoked to help students manage their schedules, practice notes, and even connect with each other. I designed the UI/UX, built the UI, and handled the backend using PostgreSQL. It was an amazing feeling seeing the app come to life, and I received wonderful feedback from the students and instructors. The project allowed me to combine my passions for music, art, and design, and I was hooked from the start. It was an incredible learning experience! The possibilities are endless! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of sustainable, intelligent, and interactive urban infrastructure. I envision a world where buildings and cities are optimized using AI-driven IoT systems to reduce energy consumption, waste management, and pollution. Imagine streets with adaptive pavement surfaces that adjust to traffic flow, or high-rises that adapt their exterior skin to changing environmental conditions. It's a future where technology and innovation merge to create a better quality of life. As a fusion of art, design, and engineering, this landscape sparks my imagination and fuels my motivation.
