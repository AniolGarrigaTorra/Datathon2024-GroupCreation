Ahaha, so, last summer I worked on a personal project that was super fun - I created a virtual reality arcade game using ARKit and Blender! I had always been interested in AR/VR, and this project allowed me to explore its capabilities. I designed and built a game where players have to shoot alien invaders in a 3D environment, which was totally cool to see come to life. The tech side was super challenging, but the creativity aspect was the most enjoyable part - seeing how I could combine my interests in programming and art to create something entirely new was amazing! As a tech-enthusiast, I'm thrilled to think about the innovative projects that will shape the future. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on the fusion of virtual and augmented reality with machine learning to create immersive experiences that redefine entertainment, education, and communication. Imagine attending virtual concerts, visiting virtual cities, or even interacting with virtual friends in a seamless AR world. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to contribute to the development of these technologies to create a more fantastical future. The datathon is a fantastic opportunity to take the first step in this adventure!
