One project that stands out to me was a personal project where I built an AI-powered chatbot for my friends' book club. I used TensorFlow and Natural Language Processing to create a bot that could engage in simple conversations, provide book summaries, and even make recommendations. It was a fun challenge to learn and implement ML, and I loved seeing my friends' reactions when they interacted with the bot for the first time. It was a non-technical project, but I got to apply my programming skills in a creative way, and it felt amazing to see people enjoy something I created. I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I'm eager to spearhead the development of an AI-powered, Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart home system. Dubbed Domus, it will integrate various sensors, automation systems, and artificial intelligence to create an unparalleled living experience. With seamless control over lighting, temperature, security, and energy consumption, Domus will prioritize convenience, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. I'm excited to push the boundaries of what's possible with Machine Learning, working with partners to refine the technology and make it accessible to the mass market. Watch out for a revolutionary smart home experience!
