I once worked on a pet project, a game-inspired AR app that allowed users to collect virtual Pok√©mon using their mobile camera. I used Computer Vision with iOS Development to detect and track objects, combined with React for the UI. Designing the UI/UX was super fun with Figma, and I experimented with AWS Amplify for backend and data storage. Seeing the first prototype come to life was an amazing feeling! What I loved most was the sense of exploration and creative freedom, without constraints of commercial pressure or tight deadlines. As a computer science student, I'm thrilled to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to be working on the development of augmented reality (AR) applications that can genuinely enhance people's lives. Imagine being able to seamlessly blend digital information with the physical world, creating immersive and interactive experiences that revolutionize industries such as retail, healthcare, and education. With advancements in technologies like AR/VR, I envision creating interactive shopping experiences, providing real-time healthcare guidance, and crafting personalized educational content. It's a future that excites me and motivates me to push boundaries.
