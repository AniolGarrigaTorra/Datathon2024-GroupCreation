I recently built a website for a local charity that helps provide art supplies to underprivileged kids. I designed the UI/UX using Flutter and HTML/CSS, and created a donation tracking system using JavaScript and Google Sheets. Seeing the website come to life and knowing it was making a difference in my community was so fulfilling! I enjoyed the challenge of combining my passions for art and social good with my programming skills. I'm thrilled to think about the future and all the possibilities it holds! In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to work on creating an AI-powered music platform that uses machine learning to recommend personalized songs to users based on their emotions and preferences. The platform would also have a social aspect, allowing users to connect with others who share similar musical tastes and moods. I envision it being a transformative tool for music discovery and enjoyment, and I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with music.
