One project that really stood out to me was when I created a mobile app to track my daily steps using React Native and IoT technology. I was really proud of how I was able to take the concept from just an idea to a fully functioning app. It was a non-technical project, so I didn't have to worry about complex algorithms or data visualizations. Instead, I could focus on designing the user interface and figuring out how to make the app user-friendly. It was a really fun project that allowed me to express my creativity and learn new skills. I'm thrilled to say that in the next 10 years, I'm eager to work on developing an AI-powered healthcare system that combines machine learning with IoT devices and blockchain technology to provide personalized, accessible, and secure healthcare services. This system would allow patients to monitor and manage their health remotely, share their medical records securely, and receive tailored treatment plans based on their unique medical needs. I envision this system revolutionizing healthcare globally, bridging the gap between rural and urban areas, and ultimately changing the face of patient-centered care. The prospect of making a meaningful impact on people's lives excites me greatly!
