I loved working on a personal project that combined my interests in music and coding! I created a react-based music player that analyzes a song's genre using a machine learning model I trained myself. I designed the interface using Figma, and even did a bit of computer vision to recognize album covers. It was amazing to see my music player recognize the correct genre and display the matching album cover! I'm thrilled to think about the future and what projects excite me. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be a part of the development of sentient, human-like AI systems that can truly complement and enhance our lives. I envision using my programming skills to create AI-assisted art generation tools, where an AI algorithm learns from a human's style and preferences to generate unique, emotionally resonant pieces. Imagine being able to co-create art with a partner that understands our creative vision and takes it to new heights! The thought of pushing the boundaries of human creativity gets me pumped!
