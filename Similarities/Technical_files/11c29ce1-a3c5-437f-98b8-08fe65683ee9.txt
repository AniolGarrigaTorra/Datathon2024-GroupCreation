I really enjoyed working on a personal project I call EchoSongs! It's an Android app that uses natural language processing and machine learning to generate original song lyrics based on a user's favorite music. I've always been a music lover, and the project allowed me to combine my passion with my programming skills. I designed the UI, developed the algorithm, and even did the initial voice-over recording for the app. Seeing users' reactions when they heard their own songs for the first time was amazing! I'm beyond thrilled about the potential of AI-infused voice-powered education systems. Imagine being able to leverage natural language processing and machine learning to create personalized, immersive learning experiences that are not only accessible but also enjoyable. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a team that develops AI-driven educational content, using voice assistants to tutor and mentor students worldwide. By integrating this technology with augmented reality, we could revolutionize the way we learn, making education more equitable, effective, and delightful. The possibilities are endless, and I'm itching to get started!
