I loved working on a non-technical project - a social impact initiative to reduce hospital-acquired infections! As a health enthusiast, I found it fascinating to delve into the statistics and data surrounding this issue. I spent hours researching, designing, and creating infographics to raise awareness about the importance of proper hygiene practices. The project allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals, and we organized a charity event, raising over $1,000 for a local hospital. It was an incredible feeling to see my passion and creativity merge with real-world social good - what's more satisfying than that? You know, I've always been fascinated by the potential of AI and machine learning to revolutionize healthcare. I'd love to work on developing cutting-edge systems that can predict and prevent diseases, or even help detect cancer earlier and more accurately. The idea of being part of a team that's working to change the world, one line of code at a time, is incredibly exciting to me. In the next 10 years, I'd love to see more breakthroughs in this space, like using AI to analyze genomic data and identify personalized treatment plans for patients. The possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to be a part of it!
