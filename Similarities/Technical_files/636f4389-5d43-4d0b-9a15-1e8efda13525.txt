One project that really stood out to me was a web app I built during my university's innovation challenge. I created a budgeting tool that used machine learning to help users track and categorize their expenses. I was responsible for the entire project, from design to deployment, and it was so satisfying to see it come together. I used Flask for the backend, React Native for the frontend, and Azure for hosting. It was my first project that I could really call my own, and it felt amazing to receive praise from users for creating something that made a real impact on their lives. The sky's the limit! In the next decade, I'm excited to work on developing a pioneering Augmented Reality platform that seamlessly integrates IoT devices, wearable technology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize healthcare. Imagine being able to visualize and interact with real-time health data, accessing personalized treatment plans, and receiving real-time guidance from medical professionals through AR-powered glasses or smart contact lenses. It's a reality that could transform the way we receive medical care, and I'm thrilled to be part of the journey. I can already see myself creating prototypes, collaborating with experts, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
