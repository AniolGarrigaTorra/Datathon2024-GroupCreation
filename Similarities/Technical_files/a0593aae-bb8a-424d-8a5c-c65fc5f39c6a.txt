I loved working on a React Native app for a friend's music production studio! As a music enthusiast, I was excited to help bring his vision to life. I was in charge of designing and building a mobile application that allowed customers to browse and book sessions with musicians, as well as track progress and get updates. I also got to add some funky music-related animations, which was super fun! Not only did I learn a lot from the project, but it also introduced me to new concepts like GraphQL and React Context API. As I think about the next decade, I'm thrilled to dive into the intersection of emerging technologies like Quantum Computing, Web3, and Natural Language Processing. I'm passionate about using these innovations to revolutionize accessibility and amplify human potential. Specifically, I envision developing AI-powered virtual reality experiences that empower individuals with disabilities, allowing them to explore the world beyond physical barriers. I believe these advancements have the potential to transform the way we live, learn, and interact, and I'm excited to contribute to shaping this future as a data enthusiast and storyteller.
