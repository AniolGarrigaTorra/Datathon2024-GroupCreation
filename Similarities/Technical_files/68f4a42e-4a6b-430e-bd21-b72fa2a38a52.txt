I'm so excited to talk about my favorite project! It was a mobile app I created with a friend to track blood glucose levels for people with diabetes. We designed the app to use IoT sensors to collect data and display it in a simple, easy-to-understand format. We also included reminders, medication tracking, and a community feature to connect with others who have diabetes. It was a huge learning experience, as I had to dig deep into machine learning, data visualization, and DevOps. Seeing people connect and share their stories made it all worth it - I loved making a real impact on people's lives! I'm thrilled to explore the convergence of design, health, and AI in the next decade. I envision creating intelligent personal wellness systems that utilize machine learning to analyze individuals' physiological and psychological data, providing tailored recommendations for optimal mental and physical well-being. Imagine an ambient, wearable device that detects early warning signs of anxiety, fatigue, or chronic stress, and discreetly responds with personalized mindfulness exercises, ambient music, or stress-reducing aromas. I'm eager to leverage my passion for design, health, and AI to make a positive impact on people's lives. The potential for innovation is immense!
