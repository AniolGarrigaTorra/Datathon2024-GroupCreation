I loved working on a Flutter-based app that helps students organize their daily schedules and reminders. I enjoyed the combination of backend and frontend development, using Python to set up the backend API and then designing the user interface with Flutter. It was a challenge to balance the tech and creative aspects, but it was so rewarding to see it come together and hear from friends who actually used the app! It's projects like these that remind me why I love coding - it's a way to bring ideas to life and make a positive impact on people's lives. I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing AI-powered solutions for sustainable urban planning! As someone who's passionate about social good and enterprise, I envision a future where cities are designed with efficiency, equity, and environmental responsibility in mind. By harnessing the power of machine learning, IoT, and spatial data, I believe we can create smarter, more resilient infrastructure that improves quality of life for all citizens. I'd love to work on developing predictive models that optimize resource allocation, traffic flow, and waste management, making our urban environments more livable and connected for generations to come.
