One project I really enjoyed working on was building a simple chatbot using Figma and SQL. I'm a huge gamer, and I wanted to create a chatbot that could interact with me and my gaming community. I designed the chatbot's UI using Figma, and then used SQL to create a database to store user interactions and responses. It was my first real programming project, and I was stoked to see it come to life. Even though it was a basic chatbot, I learned so much and had a blast doing it! I plan to improve it and add more features in the future. As a student, I've always been fascinated by the potential of AI and machine learning to revolutionize various industries. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing autonomous systems that can augment human capabilities, particularly in healthcare and finance. Imagine having AI-powered diagnostics that can identify diseases more accurately than human doctors, or robotic process automation that can streamline financial transactions and reduce errors. The possibilities are vast, and I'm eager to contribute to this exciting space. Who knows, maybe I'll even help develop the next medical breakthrough or pioneer a new fintech company!
