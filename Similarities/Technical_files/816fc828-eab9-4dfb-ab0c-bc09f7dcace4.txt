I loved working on a hackathon project where I created a game-based language learning app using React Native. The idea was to make learning a language more engaging and interactive. I was responsible for designing the game mechanics, creating the user interface, and building the app's functionality. It was an awesome experience combining my passion for gaming, web development, and NLP. Seeing my friends learn Spanish phrases and practice vocabulary through mini-games was so satisfying! The feedback from others was amazing, and I felt proud of what I had accomplished in just a weekend. What a thrilling question! Over the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive into the realm of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing. I envision creating an intuitive, human-centered AI system that assists people with cognitive disabilities, enabling them to communicate and interact with the world more effectively. This ambitious project would require me to harness machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization techniques to develop an empathetic and personalized AI interface. The prospect of leaving a lasting impact on people's lives by breaking down barriers is an incredibly motivating force for me.
