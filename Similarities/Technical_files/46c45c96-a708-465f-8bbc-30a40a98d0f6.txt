I absolutely loved working on a school project where we built an AR-based art studio using PyTorch. We developed an algorithm that could recognize shapes and allow users to manipulate 3D objects in real-time. It was incredible to see the creative possibilities that AR brought to the table! As a gamer and a fan of art, I was blown away by the level of interactivity and immersion we were able to achieve. Seeing our concept come to life was an incredible feeling, and it really sparked my interest in pursuing AR/VR development further. It was a blast learning and collaborating on that project! I'm thrilled about the prospect of exploring the intersection of enterprise, AR/VR, and databases in the next decade. I envision myself developing innovative, immersive experiences for industries like healthcare and education, using machine learning and NLP to enhance productivity and improve workflows. Specifically, I'd love to create a virtual reality platform that helps employees in high-stress fields like emergency medicine, law enforcement, or manufacturing manage their mental health and reduce burnout. By bridging the gap between AR, databases, and real-world applications, I hope to create impactful solutions that transform industries and people's lives.
