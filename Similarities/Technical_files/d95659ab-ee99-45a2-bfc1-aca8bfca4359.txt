I had a blast working on a project to create a game-based chatbot using Java! It was my first real project where I combined programming and problem-solving, and it really sparked my creativity. I designed a conversation flowchart and implemented various dialogue responses, while also ensuring that the bot could adapt to different user inputs. Seeing my chatbot come to life and interacting with real users was such a thrill! I learned a ton about user experience and UI design, too, thanks to the collaboration with friends on the Figma side of things. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on harnessing the potential of machine learning and AI to tackle real-world challenges. I envision myself as part of a team developing intelligent systems that can improve public health, optimize resource allocation, or even aid in environmental conservation. Imagine having machines that can diagnose diseases with accuracy or help us better understand and predict complex phenomena like climate change. It's a daunting task, but with the rapid advancements in AI, I believe we're on the cusp of something remarkable, and I'd love to be a part of it.
