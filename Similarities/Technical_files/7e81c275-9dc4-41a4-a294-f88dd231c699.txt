One project that comes to mind is a cybersecurity project I worked on for my university's competition, HackTheGap. My team and I created a machine learning-based intrusion detection system that uses NLP to analyze network traffic and detect potential malware. We used TensorFlow to train the model and PostgreSQL to store our dataset. It was an amazing experience because I got to combine my passion for cybersecurity and ML, and also collaborated with teammates from different backgrounds. We won first prize and I gained valuable experience working on a real-world project! As someone passionate about Cybersecurity, I'm thrilled about the potential to develop innovative solutions that safeguard our digital futures. In the next decade, I envision a project that integrates blockchain technology with AI-driven threat detection, enabling a more decentralized and secure Internet. I'd love to contribute to the development of an open-source platform that empowers individuals and organizations to protect themselves against sophisticated cyber attacks. My goal is to co-create a secure, transparent, and accountable online environment where people can explore, innovate, and communicate without fear of digital exploitation. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to get started!
