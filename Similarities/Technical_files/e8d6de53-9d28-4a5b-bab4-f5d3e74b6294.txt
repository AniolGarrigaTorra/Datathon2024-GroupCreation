One project that I really enjoyed working on was a React Native app that used AR to help people with visual impairments navigate their surroundings more easily. I loved learning about AR/VR and how it could be used to improve people's lives. It was a great experience working on a project that had real-world applications and a social impact. It also pushed me to learn about new technologies and collaborate with others who shared my passion for AR/VR. Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience that allowed me to learn and grow as a developer. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to be a part of shaping the future of healthcare through immersive technologies like AR/VR. Imagine a world where doctors and patients collaborate seamlessly, leveraging Virtual Reality to simulate surgeries and visualize complex diseases. I'd love to contribute to the development of personalized therapy programs, using Machine Learning algorithms and IoT sensors to create bespoke treatment plans. It's not just about coding; it's about humanizing healthcare and transforming lives. That's the kind of impact I'm excited to make in the next decade.
