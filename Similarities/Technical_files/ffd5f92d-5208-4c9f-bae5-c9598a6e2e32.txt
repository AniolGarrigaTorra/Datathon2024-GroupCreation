One project that really stands out to me is a gamified productivity app I built with React Native. I designed it to help students prioritize tasks and stay focused. I enjoyed the creative aspect of building an app that combines elements of gaming and productivity. The process of learning React Native was also super challenging and rewarding. Seeing my friends and peers actually use the app and finding it helpful was amazing. Plus, it was a great way to learn about user experience design and how to make complex tools simple and accessible. I'd love to build more apps like this in the future! I'm incredibly excited to be working on a project that tackles healthcare accessibility in underserved communities. In the next 10 years, I envision developing an AI-powered telemedicine platform using machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent chronic diseases, especially for populations with limited access to quality healthcare. The platform would integrate IoT devices for real-time data collection, allowing patients to receive personalized diagnoses and treatment plans remotely. My ultimate goal is to make this platform widely available, empowering people worldwide to take control of their health and wellbeing. This is a passion project that I believe could make a real difference.
