I'm excited to share a project I worked on last summer - building a mobile chatbot for my favorite pet store using Figma! I had never worked on a project that combined design and coding before, and I was really proud of how it turned out. I designed the UI/UX of the chatbot using Figma, and then wrote the backend code in Go to make it functional. It was so cool to see my designs come to life and to know that people could actually use the chatbot to ask about pet products! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the concept of augmenting human lives with cutting-edge technology. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing AI-powered wearables that integrate natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to enhance cognitive abilities and provide personalized feedback to individuals. Imagine wearing a non-invasive brain-computer interface that enhances your memory, attention span, and decision-making skills. It's a game-changer, and I'd be honored to contribute to its development. The potential to revolutionize human experience is what gets me pumped!
