I'm super passionate about projects that have a positive impact on society, so I love talking about a project I worked on where I designed and built a low-cost solar-powered water purification system for rural communities using Python, Flask, and IoT. I learned a ton about sustainable solutions, and it was amazing to see the impact it could have on people's daily lives. I worked with a team to create a user-friendly interface using HTML/CSS, and it was incredible to see the device come to life. It's projects like these that remind me why I'm in love with coding! What a great question! As a student with a passion for social good and cybersecurity, I'm thrilled to envision myself working on a project that combines these interests. In the next 10 years, I aspire to develop an AI-powered early warning system to prevent cyberattacks on vulnerable organizations, specifically non-profit organizations that support marginalized communities. This system would leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in attack simulations and provide real-time threat intelligence, empowering these organizations to proactively strengthen their defenses. My ultimate goal is to see my work contribute to a safer, more secure online environment for those who need it most.
