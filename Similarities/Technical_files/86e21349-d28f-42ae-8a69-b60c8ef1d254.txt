I had an absolute blast working on a project for a local non-profit organization that helps abandoned pets get adopted. I built a web application using HTML/CSS, Rust, and MongoDB to collect and display adoptable pet profiles, allowing potential adopters to filter and favorite pets they're interested in. I also designed the UI/UX using Figma, making sure the app was both visually appealing and easy to navigate. Seeing the pets get matched with their forever homes and hearing the happy feedback from the organization was super fulfilling! I'm thrilled to think about my dreams for the next decade. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a cutting-edge project that combines my passion for blockchain, IoT, and robotics. Imagine a smart, sustainable city where blockchain technology enables seamless data exchange between city infrastructure, smart homes, and personal devices. With IoT sensors and robots, we could create an ecosystem that reduces waste, optimizes energy consumption, and enhances the quality of life for citizens. This vision is both inspiring and daunting, and I'm excited to put in the work to help bring it to life.
