I've always loved tinkering with a project I did on natural language processing (NLP) using Python and TensorFlow. I built a simple chatbot that could understand and respond to basic user queries. It was so cool to see my code come to life and have conversations with my friends! The project was great because it required me to delve into NLP concepts like tokenization and entity recognition, and then build on that foundation to create a functional AI. The feeling of accomplishment when I saw my bot respond accurately was amazing. I can't wait to apply my NLP skills to a real-world challenge in this datathon! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on projects that push the boundaries of Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Specifically, I envision creating an AR-powered virtual training platform for underprivileged kids, focused on STEM education. Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the platform would provide immersive and interactive learning experiences, bridging the gap in access to quality education worldwide. This aligns with my passion for using technology to make a positive impact on society, and I believe it's an exciting frontier to explore in the years to come!
