I loved working on a project to develop a low-cost automated farming system using Arduino and sensor technology. As a 2nd year student, I was introduced to robotics and IoT, and this project really got me excited! I built a prototype that could monitor and control various factors like temperature, humidity, and lighting, using automation algorithms. It was an incredible feeling to see my code come to life and make a real difference in the farming process. Plus, I learned a ton about problem-solving, design thinking, and troubleshooting - all while making a potential impact on sustainable agriculture. I'm thrilled to envision myself working on developing AI-powered assistive technology for people with disabilities in the next decade. As a programmer with a passion for Social Good, I'm drawn to the potential of machine learning to revolutionize accessibility. Imagine creating intelligent systems that can read lips, translate sign language in real-time, or provide personalized support for individuals with unique needs. I'd love to collaborate with neuroscientists, occupational therapists, and advocates to bring these concepts to life, enabling greater autonomy and inclusion for people with disabilities worldwide.
