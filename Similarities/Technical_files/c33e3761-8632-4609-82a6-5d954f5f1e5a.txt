I recently built a simple chatbot using JavaScript as part of my high school project on Web Development. I was super excited to combine my love for chatbots and my emerging skills in programming! It was a fun and challenging project, as I had to learn and understand how to design a conversational AI. I created a basic bot that responds to user input and provides helpful information. It wasn't perfect, but I was thrilled to see my code come to life. I loved working on this project, and I'm hoping to create more innovative projects like this in the future! I'm thrilled to think about what I'll be working on in the next decade. My long-term vision is to contribute to the development of an AI-powered learning platform that utilizes robotic process automation to streamline educational processes. The platform would aim to make learning more efficient, effective, and accessible to everyone, regardless of geographical or financial constraints. I'd love to see students, like myself, equipped with the tools and resources needed to thrive in the ever-changing world of technology. It's a lofty goal, but I'm stoked to take the first steps towards making it a reality!
