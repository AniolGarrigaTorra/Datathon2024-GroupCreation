I had an absolute blast working on a project that combined my love for music and art! I helped create a web-based interactive art installation that used sound waves to generate colorful patterns. I designed the UI/UX using React and used PyTorch to analyze and manipulate the sound wave data. It was amazing to see the patterns come to life as users interacted with the installation. I even collaborated with friends who are musicians to create exclusive soundscapes for the installation. It was an incredible experience that combined technical skills with creative expression - definitely a highlight of my university journey! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about using data analysis and machine learning to improve healthcare outcomes, particularly for mental health patients. I envision developing an AI-powered chatbot that utilizes natural language processing to detect early warning signs of anxiety and depression. The chatbot would provide personalized recommendations for mindfulness exercises, stress-reduction techniques, and even prescribe small adjustments to daily routines to optimize mental well-being. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work towards integrating this chatbot with electronic health records, allowing healthcare providers to have data-driven insights to make more informed diagnoses and develop more targeted treatments.
