I loved working on a web development project where I built a simple social media platform for a local community. It was non-technical in a way, because I focused on making it user-friendly and visually appealing, and tech-savvy people will appreciate the simplicity. I used HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to bring it to life. The best part was seeing the impact it had on the community - people were sharing their thoughts and connecting with each other in a way that felt real and authentic. It was an amazing feeling to see something I created make a difference! What an exciting question! In the next 10 years, I'm really stoked about developing AI-powered adaptive educational systems that use machine learning to personalize learning experiences for students. I think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach education, making it more accessible, efficient, and fun! Imagine a system that uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify areas where a student may be struggling and adjusts the curriculum accordingly. I'd love to work on projects that leverage machine learning and NLP to make a positive impact on the world, and education is just the starting point.
