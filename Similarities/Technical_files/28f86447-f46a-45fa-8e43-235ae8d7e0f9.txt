I loved working on a personal project called TaskMaster - a task management app for students using Flutter! As a university student, I was tired of using old-school to-do lists and apps, so I decided to build my own. I designed the UI/UX, built the app from scratch, and even added some AI-powered features using PyTorch. It was a huge learning curve, but the sense of accomplishment was amazing. Now, I use it to keep track of assignments and stay on top of my college life. It's been a game-changer, and I'm so proud of how far I've come! I'm thrilled to share my long-term aspiration: developing a decentralized, transparent, and efficient e-commerce platform leveraging blockchain technology. Imagine a global online marketplace where transactions are secure, fast, and tamper-proof. As a datathon enthusiast, I envision crafting an AI-powered shopping assistant that utilizes natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics to provide personalized recommendations, real-time product tracking, and streamlined logistics. The platform would enable secure storage and sharing of customer data, allowing for trusted and autonomous interactions between buyers and sellers.
