I loved working on a personal project to create an AI-powered shopping recommendation system using Flask and TensorFlow. I designed a simple e-commerce platform and trained the model to analyze customer purchasing habits and suggest relevant products. The project challenged me to combine my knowledge of data analysis, machine learning, and web development. It was amazing to see my code come to life and watch the recommendations improve as I fine-tuned the model. I also learned a lot about data visualization and how to effectively communicate results to non-technical stakeholders. As a curious and innovative individual, I'm thrilled to share my ambitious aspirations for the next decade. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive deeper into the realm of Explainable AI (XAI) and its applications in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and retail. I'm fascinated by the prospect of developing AI models that can not only predict but also explain their decision-making processes, fostering greater transparency and trust. I envision working on projects that bridge the gap between humans and machines, enabling more effective and responsible AI adoption in various sectors.
