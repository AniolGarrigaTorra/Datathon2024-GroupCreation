One project that stands out to me is a personal web scraper I built using Flask and BeautifulSoup. I scraped data from a website about COVID-19 testing centers, parsed the data, and visualized it on a map using Folium. It was a great exercise in web scraping, data manipulation, and UI/UX design. What I enjoyed most was seeing the transformation from raw data to a functional tool that I could use to stay informed about testing centers in my area. It was a satisfying project that combined my interests in web development, data analysis, and practical applications. I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the concept of artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives. Specifically, I'm eager to dive deeper into AI-powered Healthcare. With the advancements in medical research and technology, I envision myself contributing to the development of personalized treatment plans, disease diagnosis, and more. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on creating an AI-driven telemedicine platform that bridges the gap between healthcare professionals and patients worldwide, making healthcare more accessible, effective, and affordable.
