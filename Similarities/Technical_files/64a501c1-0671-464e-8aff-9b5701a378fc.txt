Oh, oh! I had so much fun working on a project to create a virtual museum experience using AR technology! As a lover of art and music, I combined my interests to design an app that brought paintings to life. I worked on the front-end, using HTML and CSS to create the visual layout and interactions. It was amazing to see my designs come alive, watching users explore the digital gallery, and even discovering hidden sounds when they touched specific artworks. It was a blast to work on, and I'm super proud of what I achieved with my limited skills! I'm stoked to say that I'm deeply passionate about healthcare and its intersection with technology! In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to contribute to the development of AI-powered personalized medicine platforms that revolutionize the way we approach patient care. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can tailor medical treatment plans to individual patients' unique needs, improving diagnosis accuracy and quality of life. I'm also excited to see how VR/AR can enhance medical training and make complex surgical procedures more accessible. This is where my curiosity and passion come together!
