I had a blast working on a personal project where I built a music visualization web app using React, Go, and a MongoDB backend. I used Computer Vision to generate beautiful, interactive graphs that represented the sound waves of popular songs. I loved experimenting with different design styles and integrating a neural network to identify genres and moods. Seeing the app come to life and watching friends and family react to it was an incredible feeling. The project allowed me to combine my passions for music, art, and tech, and I'm so grateful for the experience. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionated about leveraging the intersection of data analysis and artistic expression to create immersive, human-centric experiences. In the next 10 years, I envision developing AI-powered, adaptive audio-visual interfaces that not only amplify empathy and understanding but also enable individuals to explore complex social issues through engaging, interactive narratives. Imagine using blockchain-secured databases to record and analyze the subtlest changes in public sentiment, generating insights that can inform data-driven policy decisions and drive positive global impact. This amalgamation of art, data, and tech has the potential to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with the world.
