I'm super excited to share my passion project with you! Last year, I worked on a mobile app using iOS Development to help seniors connect with their loved ones who live in long-term care facilities. The app allowed them to video call, send messages, and share photos with family and friends. It was my first major project, and I learned so much from it! Not only did I improve my coding skills, but I also gained insight into the importance of accessible technology in healthcare. It was amazing to see the impact it had on the seniors' lives and their families. I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of developing a low-cost, AI-powered exoskeleton that can aid people with mobility impairments. Imagine being able to amplify a person's abilities, giving them greater autonomy and independence. It's a challenging problem, but with advancements in machine learning, IoT, and robotic process automation, I believe it's feasible. I'm excited to contribute to a project that can improve lives and make a tangible difference.
