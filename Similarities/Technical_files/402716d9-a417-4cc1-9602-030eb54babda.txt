I had a blast working on a personal project to create an AR experience for a local museum. I designed and built an interactive display that used AR to bring exhibit artifacts to life. I used React, Go, and TensorFlow to develop the AR features, and even did some UI/UX design to make it user-friendly. Seeing the exhibit come together and receiving positive feedback from visitors was incredibly rewarding. It was a great opportunity to combine my interests in AR, music, and education in a creative way. As a programmer and data enthusiast, I'm excited to work on a project that combines my passions for education, technology, and art. In the next 10 years, I envision developing an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that uses AR and VR to revolutionize the way students learn. This platform would use machine learning algorithms to create personalized lesson plans, interactive simulations, and immersive experiences that make complex concepts more accessible and engaging. I'd love to see students around the world empowered with this technology, fostering a new generation of curious, creative, and innovative thinkers.
