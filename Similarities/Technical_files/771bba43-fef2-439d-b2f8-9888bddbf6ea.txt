One project that stood out to me was a life hack app I built during my free time using Android development. It was an app that used natural language processing to translate spoken languages in real-time, using AI models to learn from user corrections. I enjoyed the challenge of working on a project that could actually make a tangible impact on people's daily lives. It forced me to learn about ML, NLTK, and Pyaudio libraries in Python, and I was amazed by how cool it looked when it finally worked! I even released it on the Play Store, and people were actually using it! I'm excited to dive into the realm of Social Impact through Machine Learning. I envision a future where AI-powered platforms help bridge the digital divide, provide quality education and healthcare to underserved communities, and assist in climate change mitigation. I'd love to be part of a team that develops a language-processing model that helps people with disabilities, or a virtual assistance framework that assists healthcare providers in developing countries. It's a daunting but thrilling challenge, and I believe that this datathon is a great starting point for me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for creating a better world.
