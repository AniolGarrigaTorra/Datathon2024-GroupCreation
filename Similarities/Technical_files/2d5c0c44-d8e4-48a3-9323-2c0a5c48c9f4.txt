I had a blast working on a school project last semester, creating a web app using React that helps friends organize gaming nights! We developed a platform where users could search for games, create events, and invite others to join. I was in charge of implementing the recommendation algorithm, which used natural language processing to suggest games based on users' playing history and preferences. Seeing our friends use the app and hearing their positive feedback was super fulfilling. I even got to design the logo and UI using Figma! It was a great project that combined tech and my love for gaming. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about using technology to shape the future of education. In the next 10 years, I envision creating an AI-powered virtual learning environment that caters to diverse learning styles and needs. Imagine an adaptive platform that integrates personalized content, interactive simulations, and immersive games to enhance student engagement and retention. My goal is to leverage my skills in natural language processing, computer vision, and web development to develop an inclusive and effective learning tool that can bridge the knowledge gap and positively impact millions of students worldwide. That's my ultimate dream!
