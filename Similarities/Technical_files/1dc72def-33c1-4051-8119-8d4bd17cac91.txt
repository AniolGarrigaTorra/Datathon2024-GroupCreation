One project that still makes me grin is a passion project I did with some friends, creating an interactive LED art installation for our university's music festival. We designed a TypeScript-based control system to synchronize lights and visuals with music using computer vision and Android Development. It was amazing to see our creation come to life! We even used MongoDB to store settings and preferences for different songs. The event was a blast, and I loved how our project brought people together, whether through mesmerizing light shows or simply allowing them to take dope Instagram photos. I'm thrilled to share that I'm excited to make a meaningful impact in the field of environmental sustainability! In the next 10 years, I envision myself leading a team that develops innovative, AI-powered smart ecosystems to monitor and mitigate climate change. I'd love to create real-time data analysis tools to help policymakers and researchers make informed decisions. My long-term goal is to build an IoT-enabled urban agriculture network that leverages machine learning to optimize water and resource usage, promoting sustainable living. It's a lofty goal, but I'm passionate about leaving a positive footprint on the planet.
