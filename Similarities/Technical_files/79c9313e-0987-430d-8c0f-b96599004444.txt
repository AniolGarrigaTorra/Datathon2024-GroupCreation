I had a blast working on a mobile app for a school project that allowed users to generate music using a virtual piano. I got to use my C++ skills to develop the app's backend and IoT capabilities to connect it to an Arduino board that controlled a physical piano! It was awesome seeing my code come to life and hear the music being played as I typed. The non-technical side of the project was super rewarding too - I got to work with my art teacher to design the UI and collaborated with classmates on the piano sounds. As I look to the future, I'm thrilled to think about the impact I could have with my skills. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive into more advanced voice skills and work on projects that integrate AI with music and art. Imagine an app that uses machine learning to create unique soundscapes based on your emotions, or a music composition tool that uses natural language processing to adapt to your creative vision. I'd love to be part of a team that brings these kinds of innovative, intersectional projects to life and revolutionizes the way we experience and interact with music.
