One project that comes to mind is an Android app I built to help manage my daily routine. I'm a bit of a morning person, and I love creating habits that boost my energy and focus. The app allows users to set custom goals and reminders for activities like meditation, exercise, and studying. I enjoyed designing the user interface, working with Java, and integrating Android APIs to create a seamless experience. Seeing how it helped me (and my friends) stay on track motivated me to keep building and improving it. I'm thrilled to envision myself working on projects that bridge the gap between technology and social impact in the next decade! As someone fascinated by AR/VR and lifehacks, I'd love to create innovative applications that revolutionize education and accessibility. Imagine interactive, immersive learning experiences that transport students to virtual laboratories, art studios, or cultural heritage sites, making knowledge more engaging and inclusive. With my passion for social good, I aim to co-found a startup that develops such experiences, empowering future generations to grow with us. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to explore!
