I've always been obsessed with virtual reality, and I spent a few months building a VR game for my friends' birthday party. I learned a lot about Three.js and A-Frame to get it done. It was a huge success - they loved it, and I even got to incorporate some augmented reality elements. Working on it was super rewarding, as I got to combine my interests in design, programming, and gaming. Plus, seeing my friends' faces light up when they put on the VR headsets was worth all the late nights spent coding. It was an awesome project that kept me up way past my bed time! I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of contributing to the development of virtual reality-based urban planning and simulation. As someone who's fascinated by the combination of AR/VR, design, and programming, I envision creating innovative tools that allow citizens to immerse themselves in virtual models of their cities. These simulations could enhance community engagement, facilitate data-driven decision making, and empower people to envision and shape the future of their urban environments. Can you imagine the impact? It's an opportunity to combine my passions and push the boundaries of what's possible!
