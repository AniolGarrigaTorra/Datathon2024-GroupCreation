I had a blast working on a semester project in my IoT course, where I built a smart watering system for plants. I used sensors and Arduino boards to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, and then sent the data to my Android app using Bluetooth connectivity. It was amazing to see my project come to life, and I loved experimenting with different ways to visualize the data. Plus, it's so rewarding to know that I built something that can help my plants thrive! As a young cybersecurity enthusiast, I'm excited to explore the realm of decentralized autonomous systems (DAS) in the next 10 years. I'd love to see blockchain-based DAS safeguarding critical infrastructure and empowering individuals with secure, transparent, and auditable decision-making processes. I envision leveraging my programming skills in languages like Python and Flask to design secure and efficient protocols, integrated with IoT devices, and running on PostgreSQL databases. The potential to democratize decision-making and build trust in our digital infrastructure excites me, and I'm eager to learn from and contribute to this fascinating field during my career.
