One project that really stands out to me was creating an AR scavenger hunt game for my high school's hackathon. I was in charge of designing the UI and implementing the marker tracking using Computer Vision. It was my first time using those skills, and it was so much fun! I loved seeing my friends play the game and try to find the hidden targets. The thrill of watching them smile and scream when they found a marker is still vivid in my mind. That project allowed me to combine my passion for gaming and AR, and it's definitely a memory I'll treasure. I'm super stoked about the prospect of making augmented reality games a reality! Imagine being able to step into a virtual world that blends seamlessly with the real one, with characters and environments that adapt to your surroundings. The potential for immersive storytelling, interactive entertainment, and even therapeutic applications is vast. In the next 10 years, I'd love to contribute to the development of AR technology that empowers creatives to push the boundaries of what's possible. It's an exciting space, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it!
