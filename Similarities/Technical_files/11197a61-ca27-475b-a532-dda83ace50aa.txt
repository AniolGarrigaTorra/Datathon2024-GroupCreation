One project that I really enjoyed working on is an AR/VR experience for a friend's art exhibition. I've always been fascinated by the possibilities of immersive technology, and this project allowed me to dive into it. I designed the UI/UX for the experience, which was projected onto a wall and allowed viewers to interact with the artwork in a unique way. It was amazing to see people's reactions as they explored the virtual world and discovered hidden aspects of the art. It was a challenging project, but it felt so rewarding to see my creation come to life. As a passionate enthusiast of emerging technologies, I'm thrilled to think about the future possibilities. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of Artificial Reality (AR) and its limitless potential. I'd love to work on developing innovative, AR-powered productivity tools that revolutionize the way we collaborate and learn. Imagine being able to immerse yourself in virtual meeting spaces, share ideas and projects seamlessly, and have AR-powered digital notes come alive to facilitate a more engaging and interactive experience. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to be a part of shaping this future!
