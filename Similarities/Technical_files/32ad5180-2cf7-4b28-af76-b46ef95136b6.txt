I had an absolute blast working on a personal project where I built an app that used AR to bring educational content to life! It was for my school's literacy program, and I wanted to make learning more engaging for younger students. Using Flask, I created a web app that let users interact with 3D models of famous literary characters. The AR aspect was created using TensorFlow, and I even dabbled in PyTorch for some extra features. It was so cool to see students' faces light up when they used the app! I'm thrilled about the prospect of making a meaningful impact on the world through technology. In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on a project that combines my passion for education and machine learning to create a pioneering virtual reality platform designed specifically for children with special needs. This innovative tool would utilize AI-powered avatars to provide personalized learning experiences, reducing the digital divide and empowering young minds to reach their full potential. It's an ambitious endeavor, but I believe it's a game-changer, and I'd be honored to be a part of its development!
