Ah, one project that really stands out to me is this mini AR game I built for a school hackathon. I'd never worked with AR before, but I was super curious, so I dove in and taught myself Unity and ARKit. The game was about navigating a fantasy world, solving puzzles, and collecting treasure. It was a blast to see it come together, and people loved playing it! I learned so much from the experience - not just about AR development, but also about what makes a game fun and engaging. It was an awesome feeling seeing my creation bring a smile to people's faces. I'm really stoked about the potential to merge technologies to create something revolutionary! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of wearable AR devices that can read brain signals and adapt to individual mental health needs. Imagine an era where people can receive personalized mindfulness coaching and therapy through immersive, interactive experiences. By leveraging advancements in AI, neuroscience, and hardware, we can break down barriers to mental wellness and empower individuals to take control of their well-being. That's the future I'm eagerly anticipating!
