I loved working on a side project where I built a web app to help people keep track of their daily habits and tasks. I used React to create the frontend, and hooked it up to a custom-built backend using Node.js. I was proud of how it turned out, and it was a great feeling to see people actually using it and benefiting from it. What I enjoyed most was experimenting with different design and functionality iterations to make it user-friendly and fun to use. It's not a technical marvel or anything, but it's something I'm proud to have created on my own! The next decade holds immense possibilities, and I'm thrilled to share my dream project with you! I'm stoked about exploring the fusion of blockchain and augmented reality to revolutionize health monitoring and management. Imagine wearing a smart, AR-enabled wearable device that tracks your vital signs in real-time, while securely storing your data on a decentralized blockchain. This synergy could enable unprecedented patient empowerment, allowing individuals to take control of their health, making it accessible and transparent. The potential is limitless, and I envision being part of a team that breaks new ground in this domain and redefines the healthcare landscape!
