I had an absolute blast working on a personal project using Flutter to build a simple mobile game called RoboRacing. I created a track where a robot car would navigate through obstacles, and the player had to balance speed and control to complete levels. I designed the UI using Figma and developed the game's AI using machine learning algorithms. The best part was seeing the robot car learn from its mistakes and adapt to new obstacles as I improved the game. It was an awesome feeling to see my creation come to life! As a dev and data enthusiast, I'm thrilled to see how advancements in AI and ML will shape the future of healthcare. Imagine AI-powered diagnostic tools that can detect diseases earlier and more accurately, revolutionizing the way patients receive care. In the next 10 years, I'd love to contribute to the development of these groundbreaking technologies. Perhaps, I'll lead a project to create an AI-assisted clinical trial management system, streamlining the process from trial design to patient data analysis, allowing for faster and more precise discoveries. It's an exciting challenge that resonates deeply with my passion for healthcare and technology.
