I loved working on a personal project where I created a simple expense tracking app using TypeScript and Git! It was a fun and low-stakes way to explore my interest in Fintech and practice my coding skills. I designed the app's UI, set up a database, and implemented features like categorization and sorting. It was so satisfying to see my app come to life, even if it's still a rough prototype. I learned so much from the experience and had a blast experimenting and problem-solving along the way. Can't wait to put those skills to use in the datathon! As a beginner in the coding world, I'm always thinking about the bigger picture. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of autonomous systems that can make a tangible impact on people's lives. I envision working on projects that merge machine learning, IoT, and DevOps to create efficient and sustainable solutions for the FinTech industry. Imagine self-driving cars managing financial transactions and optimizing routes for urban transportation - that's the kind of challenge I'd love to tackle. With persistence and the right support, I'm confident that anything is possible.
