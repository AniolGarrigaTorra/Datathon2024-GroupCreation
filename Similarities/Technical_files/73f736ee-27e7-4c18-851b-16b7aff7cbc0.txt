I'm so stoked to talk about my IoT project where I built a smart planter that detects soil moisture and temperature, and also tracks plant growth using computer vision! I loved combining my skills in Python, React, and Data Visualization to create a web app that shows plant health metrics. The project taught me a lot about integrating physical and digital components, and I had so much fun watching my plants thrive thanks to my contraption. It was an awesome feeling knowing I could contribute to sustainable farming practices in a tiny way. Can't wait to share my project with fellow datathon enthusiasts! I'm thrilled to envision a future where I contribute to developing AI-powered educational platforms that enhance personalized learning experiences for underprivileged children worldwide. As someone passionate about Education and Machine Learning, I believe technology can bridge the gap in accessing quality education. I'd love to create an AI-driven, real-time assessment tool that adjusts its level of difficulty and teaching style according to individual learners' needs. Imagine every child having access to tailored education, tailored to their abilities and interests, empowering them to unlock their full potential. The idea keeps me up at night, and I can't wait to bring it to life.
