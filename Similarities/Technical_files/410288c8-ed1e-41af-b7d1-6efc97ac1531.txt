I'm really passionate about Productivity and Time Management, so I decided to build a simple digital planner using HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. I designed it to help students like me stay organized and focused. It allowed users to track their daily tasks, set reminders, and even analyze their productivity patterns over time. Seeing my friends use it and hearing their positive feedback was super rewarding. It wasn't a grand, complex project, but it was a great way for me to practice my coding skills while tackling a problem that I was genuinely interested in solving. I'm thrilled to think about what I can work on in the next decade! As someone with a passion for Health and Productivity, I've always been fascinated by the potential of technology to improve people's lives. I'd love to be involved in developing AI-powered solutions that help individuals with disabilities to live independently. Imagine having assistive robots that can monitor vital signs, perform daily tasks, and provide personalized care plans. It's an incredible idea that aligns with my interest in Robotic Process Automation, and I hope to be part of a team that makes it a reality.
