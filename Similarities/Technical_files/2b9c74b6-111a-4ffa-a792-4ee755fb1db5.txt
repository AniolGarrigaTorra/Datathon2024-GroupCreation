Ah, I'm totally thrilled to talk about this! During my second year of college, I worked on a project called 'HustleHub' - a mobile app that connected underprivileged youth with free resources and mentorship opportunities. I built the iOS version using my programming skills. It was amazing to see the impact we had, helping so many people access valuable services they wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. It was an incredible experience that taught me the importance of empathy and the power of innovation in making a difference. We even received a regional recognition award for it! I'm thrilled to say that I've been itching to make a meaningful impact through tech! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on using data science and machine learning to develop AI-powered tools that empower socially and environmentally conscious organizations. Specifically, I envision building an open-source platform that helps non-profits and impact investors track and analyze the success of their projects, ultimately driving more sustainable and effective solutions. It's a lofty goal, but I believe that data can be a potent catalyst for positive change, and I'm eager to contribute to that vision.
