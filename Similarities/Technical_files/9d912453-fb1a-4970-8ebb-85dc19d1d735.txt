One project that stands out to me is a data visualization tool I built for a school project. I used Flask to create a web app that took user input and displayed it in an interactive dashboard using matplotlib. I worked with a team to collect and preprocess the data, and we used SQL to manage the database. It was a great opportunity to combine my programming skills with my interest in education, and we got to present it to our class, which was a huge confidence booster. Seeing people engage with the dashboard and getting valuable insights from the data was super rewarding! As I reflect on my aspirations, I'm thrilled to envision a future where I've made a tangible impact on education. I dream of developing a personalized, AI-driven learning platform that uses IoT and machine learning to create adaptive, interactive curricula tailored to individual students' needs. This platform would revolutionize the way students learn, allowing for more effective use of resources, and providing real-time feedback to teachers. With the combination of data analysis, robotics, and social good, I'm confident that this project has the potential to change the education landscape and improve student outcomes.
