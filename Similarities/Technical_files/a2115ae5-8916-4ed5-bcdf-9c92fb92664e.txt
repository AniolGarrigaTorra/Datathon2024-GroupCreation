I loved working on a group project to develop an app for the school's infirmary. We used Swift to create an iOS app that allowed students to report their attendance, share their medical records, and even order medications. I was responsible for designing the UI and implementing the database using SQL. It was an amazing feeling to see our idea come to life and hear feedback from our peers. The project not only helped me improve my programming skills but also gave me insight into the intersection of technology and health, one of my passions. As a 17-year-old student with a passion for programming, I'm thrilled to envision my potential projects for the next 10 years. I'm particularly fascinated by the prospect of developing AI-powered wearable devices for individuals with disabilities, focusing on augmenting their daily lives. I'd love to design innovative exoskeletons, prosthetic limbs, and even smart glasses with advanced AR capabilities to empower them. This ambitious goal excites me because it combines my interests in Health, AR/VR, and Voice skills - the perfect confluence of my favorite areas to push the boundaries of what's possible and make a real difference.
