I'm super fond of a project I worked on during my summer vacation! I created a AR/VR application using Flutter to help people with dyslexia improve their reading skills. I've always been passionate about making education more accessible, and this project really brought it to life. I loved designing the user interface and programming the interactions to make the experience seamless and engaging. It was amazing to see how the app was impacting my friends who tried it out, and I learned so much about the intersection of technology and inclusivity. It was an incredible learning experience! I'm thrilled to think about the next 10 years! I'm extremely passionate about the potential of immersive technologies like AR/VR to revolutionize education and healthcare. I'd love to work on developing innovative tools and platforms that leverage these technologies to enhance student engagement, making complex concepts more accessible and interactive. Imagine a world where students can participate in virtual labs, conduct 3D simulations, and interact with AI-powered chatbots to overcome language barriers. As I progress in my career, I hope to contribute to creating a more inclusive and empathetic global community through the power of immersive technologies.
