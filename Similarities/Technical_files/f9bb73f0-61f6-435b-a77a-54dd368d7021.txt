One project that really stands out to me is a school project where I built a React-based augmented reality (AR) scavenger hunt for education purposes. I designed and developed the whole thing, from the initial idea to the final product. It was a huge challenge, but I loved every minute of it! I got to combine my interests in AR/VR, UI/UX design, and coding, which made it super engaging. The final product was a seamless, immersive experience that I was really proud of. I learned a ton about AR development, collaboration, and time management - and had an absolute blast doing it! I'm thrilled to be working on developing augmented reality (AR) interfaces for education and accessibility. Imagine being able to use your smartphone or smart glasses to immerse yourself in virtual lessons, interact with 3D models, and receive personalized tutoring. The possibilities are endless! With advancements in AR and AI, I envision a future where people with disabilities have equal access to information and opportunities. It's a daunting task, but I believe that's what drives innovation. As a developer, I'm eager to be at the forefront of shaping this technological revolution and making it a reality.
