I loved working on a personal project to create a web scraper using Python and beautifulsoup to collect restaurant reviews from food blogs. I'd always been fascinated by the idea of aggregating online reviews and making them more accessible. It was a fun challenge to learn web scraping from scratch, and I enjoyed seeing the process come together. The project also gave me a chance to dabble in natural language processing to analyze sentiment and provide insights. Seeing the aggregated reviews and sentiments visualized was super satisfying! I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of being part of the blockchain revolution! In the next 10 years, I envision being a lead developer for a decentralized application that empowers small-scale farmers to effectively monitor and maintain their crops, as well as manage sales and logistics seamlessly. I'm thinking of using advanced computer vision techniques to create a precise crop monitoring system, integrated with AI-driven forecasting and blockchain-based record-keeping. This would allow for transparent and secure transactions, reducing inefficiencies and costs for farmers, and ultimately promoting sustainable and equitable food systems globally.
