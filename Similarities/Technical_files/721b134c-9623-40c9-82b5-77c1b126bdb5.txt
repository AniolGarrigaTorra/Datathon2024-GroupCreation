I had a blast working on a personal project where I built a simple AR game for my friends using ARKit and Swift. It was my first attempt at mobile game development, and I loved the creative process of designing the game's concept, coding the mechanics, and testing it out with friends. Seeing it come to life and watching them have fun with it was an amazing feeling. I was nervous at first about the coding parts, but Apple's resources and online forums really helped me get through any obstacles. I learned so much and had a great time! What an exciting question! As I look ahead to the next decade, I'm incredibly passionate about the potential of AI-powered, wearable brain-computer interfaces. Imagine wearing a simple, stylish headset that seamlessly translates your brain activity into tangible interactions, revolutionizing the way we communicate, create, and learn. I envision designing augmented reality interfaces for neurodiverse individuals, enabling them to tap into their inner world and express themselves in new, empowered ways. It's a lofty dream, but I believe the future of human-computer interaction holds endless possibilities, and I'd be thrilled to play a role in shaping it!
