One of my favorite projects was a semester-long group project where we developed a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to assist customers with purchases in an e-commerce platform. I was responsible for implementing the ML model in Python using scikit-learn, and it was amazing to see it learn and improve over time. I enjoyed working with my team, and we learned a lot from each other's strengths and weaknesses. It was great to see the final product come to life and know that our chatbot could make a real difference in people's shopping experiences. I'm thrilled about the potential to merge my passions for e-commerce, voice skills, and blockchain to create a revolutionary retail experience. Imagine walking into a physical store and interacting with a conversational AI assistant that uses computer vision to detect your style and offer personalized product recommendations based on your fashion choices. The twist? The entire interaction is secured by blockchain, ensuring that your data remains anonymous and secure. I envision a seamless integration of digital and physical retail, where consumers can enjoy a personalized experience while retaining control over their data. It's a future that excites me!
