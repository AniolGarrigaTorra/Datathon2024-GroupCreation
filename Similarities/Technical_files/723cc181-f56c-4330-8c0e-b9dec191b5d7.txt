I had a blast working on a mobile game I created with friends for a university hackathon. We decided to build a augmented reality treasure hunt game called Questify where players use their phones to find hidden items in real-world locations. We used Flutter to develop the app and Python to create a custom AI-powered algorithm that helped determine the item's proximity. What I loved about this project was seeing the game come to life and watching users' reactions when they found hidden items. It was an amazing feeling to see our hard work pay off and to know we were creating something unique and fun! The next 10 years! I'm ecstatic to think about the potential possibilities. Specifically, I'm excited to explore the intersection of AI and healthcare. Imagine wearable devices capable of detecting subtle physiological changes, allowing for early disease diagnosis and personalized treatment plans. I envision augmenting reality overlays providing real-time health guidance, and predictive analytics optimizing medication schedules. The possibilities for improving human lives are endless, and I'd love to be a part of shaping this future. The idea of harnessing AI to enhance our well-being and combat chronic diseases is truly exhilarating, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the research and development.
