I had an absolute blast working on a Raspberry Pi-based home automation project for my dorm's hackathon a while back. I love tinkering with IoT devices and teaching others about the possibilities. For this project, I designed a sleek interface using Figma and coded a user-friendly UI using Rust. The best part was setting up sensors and actuators to automate tasks like adjusting lighting and temperature in my dorm room. It was so satisfying to see my project come to life and share it with friends, seeing how it sparked their interest in coding and technology. I'm really enthusiastic about working on personalized education platforms that utilize AI to create bespoke learning experiences for students. I've always been fascinated by the potential for technology to revolutionize the way we learn, and I believe that AI can help tailor education to individual learners' needs and styles. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a team that develops an AI-powered education platform that not only helps students learn more effectively but also makes learning more engaging and fun. It's a lofty goal, but I think it's achievable, and I'd be honored to play a role in making it happen!
