One project that really stood out to me was a wearable health tracker I built using IoT and Flask. I was really passionate about the idea of creating a device that could track and monitor vital signs in real-time. I used C++ to create the firmware for the sensor board and Flutter to build the mobile app. Seeing it come together and having it work was an amazing feeling! I loved the hands-on aspect of working with hardware and pushing my programming skills. Plus, it was so cool to see how the data was impacting the user's health and wellness. I'm thrilled to think about the impact I'd like to make in the next decade! As a designer with a passion for healthcare, I'd love to be part of a team developing AI-powered medical devices that empower patients to take control of their health. Imagine wearable tech that learns an individual's habits and behaviors, providing personalized recommendations to maintain optimal well-being. The fusion of machine learning, IoT, and user-centered design fascinates me, and I can't wait to explore the possibilities. My goal is to contribute to creating technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives.
