I loved working on a non-technical project, creating a art series titled Hues of Hope! It's a collection of digital paintings that blend vibrant colors and whimsical shapes to spread positivity and encouragement. I experimented with different artistic tools and software, and even taught myself basic digital painting techniques. Seeing the series come together was so fulfilling - I had a blast exploring my creative side and received amazing feedback from friends and family. It showed me that there's beauty in stepping away from code and embracing the creative chaos. As a student with a passion for E-commerce and Retail, I've always been fascinated by the concept of a seamless omnichannel experience. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing a retail technology that uses AI and blockchain to create a transparent and personalized shopping journey for customers. Imagine walking into a physical store and having the same experience as online, with your preferred products and promotions waiting for you, all while ensuring data privacy and security. That's my dream - to revolutionize the way people shop and shopkeepers manage their stores.
