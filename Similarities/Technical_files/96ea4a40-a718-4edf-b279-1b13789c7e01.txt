OH MY GOSH, I just loved working on a school project where we designed a website for a local animal shelter! As a comm and design major, it was amazing to combine my passions. We used WordPress to build the site, and I got to learn some basic coding skills in HTML/CSS. It was so cool seeing our designs come to life and knowing that our project would actually help make a difference in the community. I loved collaborating with my team and seeing the website grow and evolve. It was an awesome experience that ignited my passion for web design and development! As I imagine my future, I'm thrilled to think about creating a platform that empowers people to make healthier lifestyle choices through personalized recommendations and data-driven insights. I'd love to combine my passion for design, communication, and programming to develop an innovative app that uses machine learning and data analytics to track individuals' progress, identify trends, and provide holistic support. In 10 years, I envision a world where this platform becomes a go-to resource for millions of people, making a meaningful impact on public health. It's a big dream, but I'm ready to put in the hard work to make it a reality!
