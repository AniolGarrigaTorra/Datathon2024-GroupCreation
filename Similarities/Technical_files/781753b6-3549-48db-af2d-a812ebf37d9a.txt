I'd say one of my favorite projects was creating a simple mobile app using React Native, which helped friends and family track their daily steps and calories burned. I loved the design challenge of crafting a seamless user experience using Figma, and the programming challenge of implementing functionality like API integration and data storage. Seeing the app come to life and receiving feedback from users was super rewarding! It was a great way to apply my skills in a real-world context, and I enjoyed the process of learning and problem-solving as I went along. I'm absolutely thrilled to think about the projects I'll have the opportunity to work on in the next decade. A specific area that really gets me pumped up is the intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming. I envision a future where immersive, realistic virtual worlds are not only possible but commonplace. As a programmer, I'd love to contribute to the development of AI-powered game engines that can learn and adapt to players' preferences and behaviors. Imagine a world where games are personalized, unpredictable, and even therapeutic - the potential for positive impact on people's lives is truly exciting!
