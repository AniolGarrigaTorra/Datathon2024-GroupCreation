I had a blast working on a personal project that combined my passions for AR/VR and Design! I created a virtual art gallery using Unity and Blender, where visitors could immerse themselves in an interactive environment featuring my own artwork. It was amazing to see how tech-savvy I could be and experiment with different storytelling techniques. The project also helped me develop my skills in 3D modeling, coding, and problem-solving. I love how it showcased my creativity and technical abilities - and I even got to share it with friends and family, which was a fantastic feeling! I'm absolutely stoked to talk about this! As a huge fan of innovation and emerging technologies, I'm excited to see where the convergence of quantum computing and artificial intelligence takes us. Imagine developing more efficient, optimized solutions to tackle some of humanity's most pressing challenges - climate change, sustainable energy, and advanced medicine, to name a few. I'd love to be part of a team pushing the boundaries of what's possible with quantum-inspired machine learning and develop practical applications that can improve lives. The potential is vast, and I can't wait to see the breakthroughs!
