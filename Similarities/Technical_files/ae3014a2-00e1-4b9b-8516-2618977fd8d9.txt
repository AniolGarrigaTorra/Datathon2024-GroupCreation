I had an amazing time working on a personal project, SmartMinder! It's a mobile app that uses AI-powered to-do lists and Habitica, a gamified task manager, to help individuals stay focused and achieve their goals. As a UI/UX Designer, I crafted a clean and intuitive interface, while building the iOS app using React Native. I also implemented database integration with PostgreSQL and designed the app's API using React. This project allowed me to combine my passions for programming, design, and personal growth. I've received wonderful feedback from beta testers, and it's been thrilling to see people enjoy the app! I'm thrilled to share that I'm excited to explore the fusion of technology and creative expression! In the next decade, I envision developing a novel application that harnesses the power of AI and machine learning to create generative art and music. I'd love to collaborate with artists, musicians, and developers to design an innovative platform that empowers users to co-create stunning visuals and auditory experiences. This cutting-edge technology could transform the creative landscape, bridging the gap between human imagination and computational capabilities. It's an ambitious dream, but I'm eager to take on the challenge!
