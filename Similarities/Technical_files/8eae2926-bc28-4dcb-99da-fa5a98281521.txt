One project that really stood out to me was when I built a machine learning model to analyze and generate music using Python and TensorFlow. I've always been a huge music lover, and this project allowed me to merge my passion with my coding skills. I spent hours collecting and preprocessing a dataset of song metadata and music features, and then trained a model to predict song genre and artist based on those features. It was amazing to see the model learn and improve over time, and even more thrilling to use it to generate new song recommendations. I'm truly passionate about using my programming skills to make a positive impact on the world. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on a project that utilizes AI and machine learning to address healthcare disparities in underprivileged communities. I envision a virtual assistant that uses natural language processing to provide accessible and personalized health advice, while also identifying and addressing social determinants of health. This dream project not only aligns with my values, but also represents a massive opportunity to combine my passion for coding, social good, and music/art - with music being an integral part of the user experience.
