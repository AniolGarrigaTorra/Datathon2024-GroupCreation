I had an absolute blast working on a project that combined my interests in Communication and AR/VR! It was a virtual event simulation platform using Unity and Unity ML-Agents. The idea was to create an immersive experience for event organizers to visualize and test their events before the actual event took place. I enjoyed bringing my skills in Machine Learning and Docker together to build a functional prototype. Seeing the enthusiasm of my teammates and witnessing the prototype come to life was amazing. It was a true collaborative effort, and I loved how we were all working towards a single, exciting goal! I'm stoked to think about my future ambitions! In the next 10 years, I'm itching to make a meaningful impact in education using emerging technologies like AR/VR. I'd love to develop an innovative platform that combines cutting-edge gamification with artificial intelligence to create an immersive learning experience for underprivileged students. The ultimate goal is to bridge the education gap and provide access to quality education worldwide. I envision a world where technology democratizes knowledge, breaking geographical and socioeconomic barriers, and I'd be thrilled to be a part of that movement!
