I had an absolute blast working on a personal project called MoodMingle, a AI-powered emotional wellness app for teenagers. As a UI/UX enthusiast, I designed the app to connect users with like-minded friends and provide calming mood-boosting activities. I developed the app using React and Go, and implemented computer vision for emotion detection using TensorFlow. What got me pumped was seeing how my creation could help teens cope with mental health struggles, making friends with other passionate developers who shared my vision, and learning to empathize with the app's users through their stories. I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing innovative medical devices powered by AI and blockchain! As a student in health-related areas, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative potential of technology in medicine. I envision creating wearable, non-invasive devices that use computer vision and IoT to monitor and analyze vital signs in real-time, allowing for more targeted and personalized treatments. Additionally, integrating blockchain ensures secure and transparent data storage, eliminating data silos and empowering patients with ownership of their health records. I'm excited to make a tangible impact on people's lives and advance the healthcare industry in the next decade!
