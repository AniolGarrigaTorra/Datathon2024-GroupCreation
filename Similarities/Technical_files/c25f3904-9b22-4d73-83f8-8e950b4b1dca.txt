One project I'm really proud of is a natural language processing-powered chatbot I built to assist students with learning disabilities. I used MongoDB to store student profiles and React Native to create a user-friendly interface. I integrated Google's Natural Language Processing API to analyze student responses and provide personalized feedback. I also designed the UI/UX using Figma to ensure the app was accessible and easy to navigate. Watching students' confidence grow as they interacted with the chatbot was incredible! I'm thrilled to share that in the next decade, I'm hoping to play a role in revolutionizing the healthcare industry through AI-driven voice assistants! With my passion for natural language processing and computer vision, I envision creating intelligent systems that enable patients to manage their care and communicate seamlessly with healthcare providers. Imagine being able to schedule appointments, track symptoms, and even monitor vital signs just by chatting with a voice AI. It's an exhilarating prospect to tackle some of the industry's biggest challenges and make a tangible impact on people's lives. The possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to contribute to this frontier!
