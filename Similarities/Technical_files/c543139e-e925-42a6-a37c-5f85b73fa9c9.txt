I actually worked on a little side project where I built a simple game using Figma's layout editor! I'm a huge gamer myself, and I wanted to experiment with using design skills for something technical. It was so much fun to build a functional game from scratch, and I was surprised by how well my design skills translated to programming. It was a small-scale project, but it taught me a ton about iteration and problem-solving. I loved the sense of accomplishment when I finally got everything working smoothly! I'm thrilled to think about the next decade. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems that can augment human cognition and revolutionize industries like gaming, healthcare, and education. I envision a world where AGI-powered tools enable real-time data analysis, predict outcomes, and offer personalized solutions. As a programming enthusiast, I'm eager to contribute to shaping the future of AI and its applications. Who knows? Maybe one day, I'll even create an AI-powered gaming platform that disrupts the entire entertainment industry! The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to dive in.
