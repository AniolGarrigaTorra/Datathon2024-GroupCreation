I had a blast working on a project where I built a smart trash can using IoT technology and Machine Learning. The trash can could detect when it was full and send me a notification, and I even implemented a module to sort recyclables from non-recyclables using computer vision. It was a great opportunity to integrate my programming skills with my interest in IoT and sustainability. Not only was it a challenging technical project, but it also allowed me to contribute to a social cause, which gave me a sense of fulfillment. I'm thrilled to think about the impact I'd like to make in the next decade. One thing that really gets me pumped up is the convergence of IoT, AI, and security. I'd love to work on developing intelligent, self-healing smart city infrastructure that utilizes real-time sensor data to optimize resource allocation and predict potential security vulnerabilities. Imagine it - streets that can adapt to traffic congestion, parking spots that adjust to demand, and energy grids that predict and prevent outages. It's a dream worth chasing, and I believe the datathon is a great step in building the skills needed to make it a reality.
