I loved working on a project where I used my programming skills to create a wearable IoT device that could recognize and respond to music using gestures. It was an amazing feeling to see the device come to life, reacting to the beats and rhythms in real-time. I worked with a team to design and build the device, from writing the code in Rust to prototyping and testing the device itself. Seeing the wearable device in action, watching people's reactions, and getting feedback from them was incredibly rewarding. It was an incredible experience that pushed my coding skills and creativity to new levels! I'm really passionate about the potential intersection of IoT, AR/VR, and machine learning. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a project that creates an immersive, interactive environment that seamlessly integrates physical and digital worlds. Imagine being in a smart home or city where devices communicate with you and each other, and virtual avatars augment reality to enhance your daily life. I'm excited to work on developing the software infrastructure to bring this vision to life, maybe even exploring ways to leverage blockchain for data security and ownership. It's a tall order, but I'm excited to tackle it!
