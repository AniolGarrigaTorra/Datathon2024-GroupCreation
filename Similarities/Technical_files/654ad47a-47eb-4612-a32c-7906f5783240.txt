I've had a blast working on a personal project - a text-based RPG game built using Python and Flask! It was an amazing feeling to design a game from scratch, deciding on storylines, characters, and game mechanics. I loved experimenting with PyTorch for some AI-powered NPC interactions and rusty old Rust for some game mechanics. The best part? I got to learn about design thinking and user testing through beta testing with friends and family. It was incredible to see how the game evolved and improved over time. Who knew building a game could be so therapeutic and entertaining? I'm thrilled to see myself spearheading the development of an artificial intelligence-powered non-profit organization that provides accessible, personalized healthcare services to underprivileged communities worldwide. Envisioning a future where AI assists in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, I aim to combine my passion for social good with my technical skills. Imagine an AI-driven telemedicine platform that leverages machine learning algorithms to provide timely and accurate medical guidance, bridging the gap between healthcare professionals and remote patients. This endeavor excites me, as it not only fosters positive change but also enables me to stay at the forefront of the tech-savvy frontier.
