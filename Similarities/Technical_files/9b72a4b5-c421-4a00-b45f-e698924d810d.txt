I've loved working on a web app I built using React Native for a friend's bakery. She wanted a website where customers could place orders, track their purchases, and leave reviews. I enjoyed combining my passion for baking with coding! I set up a PostgreSQL database to store orders and customer info, then used iOS and Flutter development to create a mobile-friendly website. Seeing the finished product come together and getting positive feedback from my friend and her customers made it all worth it. It's projects like these that remind me why I love coding - making a difference and having fun! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to have made a significant impact in the world of e-commerce with my programming skills. I'd love to create a revolutionary online shopping platform that combines AI-powered recommendations, social media integration, and augmented reality try-before-you-buy experiences. This platform would allow customers to browse and discover new products in a more immersive and engaging way. I'd also love to work on developing sustainable logistics and supply chain management systems to reduce environmental waste. The prospect of making a difference in the retail industry while having fun pushing the boundaries of technology excites me!
