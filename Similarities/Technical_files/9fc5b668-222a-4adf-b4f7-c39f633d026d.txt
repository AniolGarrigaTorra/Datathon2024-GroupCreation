One project that really got my creative juices flowing was building a smart home automation system for my family's tiny apartment. I used Raspberry Pi and Python to connect various devices, like lamps and appliances, to the internet. Then, I created a mobile app with React Native to control everything remotely. It was a ton of fun experimenting with Computer Vision to detect and recognize objects, and I loved the feeling of being able to turn on the living room lights with just a smile on my face. My family loved it too - they'd often complain about having to get up to switch off the lights at night! I'm thrilled to share that I've been dreaming of working on a real-time retail inventory management system powered by computer vision and machine learning. As someone fascinated by E-commerce and IoT, I envision a future where shelves can automatically detect and update inventory levels, reducing waste and making the supply chain more efficient. I'd love to develop a prototype using PyTorch and React, integrating computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze camera feeds and optimize inventory levels. The idea excites me because it combines my passion for tech, data analysis, and retail, with the potential to revolutionize the industry.
