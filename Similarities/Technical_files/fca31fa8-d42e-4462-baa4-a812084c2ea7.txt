I've enjoyed working on a personal project where I used computer vision to create a system that detects and recognizes hand movements to control a piano-like digital interface. I built the interface using Flutter and integrated the computer vision algorithm using OpenCV and TensorFlow. It was amazing to see the system come to life and be able to control the interface with simple hand gestures! This project was a great way for me to combine my interests in music, art, and programming, and I'm excited to continue developing it. As I gaze into the future, I'm thrilled to envision a world where technology seamlessly intersects with social responsibility. I'd love to dedicate my skills to developing AI-powered healthcare systems that bridge the gap between marginalized communities and quality care. Imagine a reality where machine learning algorithms help diagnose and treat diseases with unparalleled precision, empowering healthcare providers to focus on the human touch. I envision collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams to create blockchain-enabled healthcare databases, ensuring patient data sovereignty and security. The prospect of using my programming prowess to amplify social good sends shivers of excitement down my spine!
