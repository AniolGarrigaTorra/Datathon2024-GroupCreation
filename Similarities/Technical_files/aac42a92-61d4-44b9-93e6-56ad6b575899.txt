I had a blast working on a non-technical project that combined my love for design and creative writing! I created a virtual vision board as a digital planner, where I could curate inspirational quotes, stunning visuals, and goals. It was a way for me to express myself and prioritize my mental well-being during a challenging semester. I enjoyed experimenting with different colors, typography, and composition to create a visually striking atmosphere. Even though it was a simple project, it felt fulfilling to see my digital art come together. It's projects like this that keep me hooked on design! I'm thrilled to share that I'm incredibly excited to explore the possibilities of AR and VR in revolutionizing various industries. Imagine walking into a medical center and being able to visualize and interact with 3D patient data, or experiencing immersive therapy sessions without the physical constraints of traditional therapy. These technologies have the potential to change the game, and I'm eager to be a part of the innovation process. In the next 10 years, I envision myself contributing to the development of pioneering projects that blend design, tech, and human emotions, pushing the boundaries of what's imaginable.
