I had a blast working on a mobile app project during my school's coding club. I collaborated with friends to create a social media platform that connected local artists with potential buyers. I handled the iOS development part, learning Swift as I went along. It was amazing to see our project come together, and we even got to showcase it at a school event! I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of developing an AI-powered music production tool that helps musicians and composers create unique and catchy tunes. As someone who's passionate about music and design, I envision a platform that utilizes natural language processing, machine learning, and generative algorithms to produce harmonious melodies, chord progressions, and rhythms. The goal is to make music creation more accessible and inspiring for everyone, regardless of their skill level. It's a challenging but exciting project that I believe has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and open up new avenues for artistic expression.
