Oh, I just loved working on a project where I used computer vision to build a sign language recognition system! As a linguistics minor, I've always been fascinated by languages, and sign language holds a special place in my heart. I used TensorFlow to train a model that could detect and recognize hand gestures, and it was incredibly rewarding to see it in action. I worked with a group of friends, and it was amazing to see how our diverse skills and interests came together to create something really cool. We even pitched it to a local organization that supports deaf students! I'm genuinely excited to work on developing AI-powered systems that enhance accessibility and quality of life for people with disabilities. As someone who's passionate about cybersecurity and health, I envision using machine learning to create smart, adaptive technology that predicts and prevents chronic illnesses, improving patient outcomes and caregiver efficiency. I'd love to collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate artificial intelligence with biomedical engineering, and work towards empowering individuals with unique abilities to take control of their health and wellbeing. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm convinced that the next decade will be an era of exponential breakthroughs in healthcare AI.
