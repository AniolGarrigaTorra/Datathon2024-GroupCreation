I loved working on a side project called SoundWave! I built an Alexa skill that allowed users to control their smart home devices using voice commands. I was able to combine my interests in Voice skills and Enterprise to create something that integrated with popular smart home devices. I enjoyed the process of designing and implementing the skill, and even did a few tests with my friends who loved the convenience it brought to their homes. It was a great project to showcase my programming skills and creativity, and I got some great feedback from the development community! What gets me stoked is the prospect of integrating my interests in voice skills, education, and cybersecurity to create a revolutionary platform for learners. Imagine an AI-powered avatar that can interact with students, adapt to their learning pace, and provide personalized feedback in real-time. It would utilize natural language processing, blockchain for secure storage, and blockchain-based credentials for authentication. This platform would transform the way we learn, making education more accessible, inclusive, and effective. It's an ambitious vision, but I believe the fusion of emerging technologies and my passion for education can make it a reality.
