I'd say I had a blast working on a project to design a mobile app for tracking personal medication adherence. I'm super passionate about Health and Wellness, so it was a dream come true to be able to apply my programming skills to create something that could positively impact people's lives. I enjoyed designing the UI/UX, building the backend using Android Development, and linking it all together with Data Analysis to generate insights. The most rewarding part was testing it out on my own family members and seeing them stick to their medication regimen! I'm absolutely stoked to be living in an era where technology is revolutionizing healthcare! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of AI-powered wearable devices that can detect early signs of diseases, allowing for prompt interventions and more targeted treatments. Imagine wearing a smartwatch that can monitor your vital signs and alert your doctor if something's off, even if you're on the other side of the world. The possibilities are endless, and I'm pumped to be a part of shaping this future - bringing people better health, better life, and more quality time with loved ones.
