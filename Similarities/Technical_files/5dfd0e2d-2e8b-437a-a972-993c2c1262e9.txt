I loved working on a side project where I created a mobile app for people with mobility impairments to control their smart home devices using voice commands. I used React Native to build the app and linked it with my home automation system using IFTTT. Seeing it come together and being able to test it with friends who have mobility impairments was super rewarding. The devOps aspect of setting up Continuous Integration/Deployment pipeline with Jenkins and Docker was also a new skill I picked up, which helped me feel more efficient and confident in my ability to scale the app. I'm thrilled to think about the potential breakthroughs in healthcare technology! With my background in programming and passion for health, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of both. In the next 10 years, I hope to work on developing AI-powered wearable devices that could accurately predict and prevent chronic illnesses. Imagine wearables that can monitor vital signs, analyze data, and alert doctors to take preventive measures. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach healthcare, and I would love to be a part of shaping this future! The excitement of the datathon has already got me thinking...
