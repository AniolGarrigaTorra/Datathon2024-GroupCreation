One of my favorite projects was creating a music visualizer app using Flutter and Computer Vision techniques. I wanted to combine my passion for music and art, and this project allowed me to do just that. I used Machine Learning algorithms to detect beats and analyze audio frequencies, and then used that data to create dynamic visual effects in real-time. It was amazing to see my design come to life! The end result was an immersive experience that reacted to music in ways that seemed magical. It was an incredible feeling, merging art and tech to create something truly unique and enjoyable. As I look ahead, I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities. In the next decade, I'd love to make a meaningful impact on mental health awareness through technology. I'm excited to work on AI-powered chatbots that can detect and prevent anxiety episodes by monitoring users' emotions and providing personalized recommendations for relaxation techniques. My goal is to create a platform that bridges the gap between technology and empathy, making mental wellness more accessible and stigma-free. This dream project combines my passions for design, programming, and health - a true intersection of art and science.
