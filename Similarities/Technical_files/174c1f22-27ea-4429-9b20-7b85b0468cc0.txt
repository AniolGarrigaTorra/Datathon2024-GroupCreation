I absolutely loved working on a game development project for a friends' startup. I was in charge of building a companion bot for their multiplayer online game using JavaScript and Flask. The bot would assist players in finding resources and navigating the game world. I also implemented a basic leveling system using PyTorch, which gave me a great insight into machine learning. Seeing the bot come to life and watching friends and family enjoy the game was super fulfilling. It was an amazing experience that combined my love for gaming and programming! I'm excited to work on developing personalized, adaptive learning systems that utilize natural language processing and machine learning to create more effective educational experiences. I envision a future where AI-powered tools analyze an individual's learning behavior, providing real-time feedback and adjusting the content to meet their specific needs. This would revolutionize the way we learn, making education more accessible and inclusive. I believe that combining my passion for education with the power of data analysis and machine learning could have a profound impact on shaping the future of education.
