I'm obsessed with AR/VR, so I recently worked on a project to create an interactive virtual museum experience using React, Unity, and Flutter. My goal was to make art history come alive! I created an app that allowed users to explore an immersive, 3D gallery, complete with interactive exhibits and informative tutorials. I loved the creative challenge of bridging the worlds of design, tech, and art. Plus, I got to experiment with spatial audio and motion controls - it was a blast! Seeing users explore the app and marvel at the artwork's alive nature still gives me chills. I'm thrilled to share that I'm excited about the prospect of developing innovative, AI-powered, AR-based solutions that bridge the physical and digital worlds. As a designer and developer at heart, I'm fascinated by the potential of AR to revolutionize the way we interact with each other, learn, and work. In the next 10 years, I envision crafting intuitive, immersive experiences that enhance daily life, from education to enterprise, making complex tasks more accessible and engaging. Imagine being able to explore 3D models of city architecture while walking through the streets, or virtual whiteboards coming to life in meetings - the possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to shape them!
