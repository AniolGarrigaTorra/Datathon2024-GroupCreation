I'm absolutely obsessed with my IoT project where I designed and built a smart garden that tracks and takes care of my little succulent friends! I used Go as the programming language to create a GUI that monitors the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels, sending notifications when it needs watering or pruning. I even incorporated voice assistant integration using Google Assistant! It was so rewarding to see my creation come to life and watch my plants thrive. It's the perfect combination of tech and biology, and I can't wait to explore more IoT projects like this in the future! I'm thrilled about the prospect of creating a cutting-edge healthcare platform that utilizes AI and IoT to personalize patient care. As someone with a passion for Design and Health, I'm excited to explore the possibilities of designing seamless patient experiences through interactive wearables and predictive analytics. I envision a future where patients can track their vital signs and receive tailored recommendations to manage chronic conditions, and healthcare professionals can receive actionable insights to deliver more effective care. The idea of making a meaningful impact on people's lives through data-driven innovation truly gets me pumped!
