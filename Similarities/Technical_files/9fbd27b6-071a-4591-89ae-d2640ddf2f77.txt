I had a blast working on a Python project that created a simple AR game using Unity and Vuforia. I designed and developed an interactive game where users could point their phone's camera at real-world objects, and it would display 3D models and animations on top of them. I loved combining my skills in programming, design, and communication to bring this idea to life. Seeing the game come together and sharing it with friends was such a thrill! It sparked my passion for AR/VR development, and I'm excited to explore more projects like this in the future. What an exciting question! As someone who's passionate about Health and AR/VR, I'm thrilled to think about the potential breakthroughs we'll see in the next decade. I envision a future where AR glasses have become an essential tool for patients, empowering them to monitor and manage their health seamlessly. Patients would be able to access their medical records, track medication, and even receive therapy sessions in the most intuitive and immersive way possible. This technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve people's lives worldwide. And, of course, I'm excited to be a part of shaping this future!
