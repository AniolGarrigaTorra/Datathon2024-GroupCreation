I loved working on a personal project that used machine learning to recommend skincare routines based on users' facial features. I used Python and PyTorch to train a convolutional neural network on a dataset of skincare product reviews and user selfies. Then, I built a simple web app using React and Figma to allow users to upload their own photos and receive personalized routine recommendations. It was amazing to see how the model could learn to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions. The best part was experimenting with different architectures and techniques to improve the model's performance! I'm beyond excited to work on a project that combines my passion for social good, AI, and healthcare. In the next 10 years, I envision developing a personalized predictive analytics platform that leverages machine learning and IoT technologies to help medical professionals diagnose and prevent chronic diseases. Imagine having the ability to detect health issues early on, reducing the risk of mortality and improving quality of life for millions of people worldwide. It's a daunting task, but with continued advancements in AI and data analysis, I firmly believe it's within reach, and I'm eager to contribute to its realization.
