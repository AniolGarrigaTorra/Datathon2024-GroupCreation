I've had a blast working on a passion project where I combined my love for music and art with my programming skills. I created a AI-generated guitar tabulator that uses computer vision to identify musical notes and chords in sheet music, and then uses machine learning to provide a clean and simplified tablature. It was an incredible experience to see my idea come to life, and I enjoyed the challenge of bridging the gap between the musical and programming worlds. It was a great way to exercise my creativity and problem-solving skills, and I'm stoked to showcase it at the datathon! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the prospect of developing AI-powered art generation platforms that can create unique, meaningful pieces that not only challenge the conventional notions of creativity but also provide a new medium for people to express themselves. Imagine being able to input emotions, experiences, or thoughts into a machine, and then having it generate a visual representation that's not only visually stunning but also profoundly resonates with the human psyche. That's what gets me fired up for the next decade - pushing the boundaries of art, technology, and human connection.
