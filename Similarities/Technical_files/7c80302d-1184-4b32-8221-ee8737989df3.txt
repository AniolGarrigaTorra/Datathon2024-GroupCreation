I'd say my favorite project so far has been building a simple chatbot using TypeScript and Voice skills! I was completely new to both concepts when I started, but I was really excited to dive in and figure it out. There was something so satisfying about watching my chatbot come to life and having it actually respond to user input. Plus, it was cool to see how voice commands could be used to automate daily tasks. I loved learning about NLP and how it can be applied to real-world problems. It's definitely reignited my passion for coding! As a novice programmer, I'm excited to delve into the world of machine learning and AI, specifically in voice technology. I envision a future where virtual assistants are not just equipped with basic conversation skills but can actually understand human emotions and empathize with us. My ultimate goal is to develop a system that utilizes machine learning and blockchain to create a safe and secure emotional health monitoring platform. This platform would allow people to anonymously express their feelings and emotions, receiving personalized support and resources to improve their mental wellbeing. It's an ambitious project, but I'm ready to take on the challenge!
