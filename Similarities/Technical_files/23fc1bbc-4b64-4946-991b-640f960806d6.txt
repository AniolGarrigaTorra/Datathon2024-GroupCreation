I worked on a project to create an AI-powered chatbot that could assist gamers in finding teammates for online multiplayer games. I utilized JavaScript to build the chatbot's front-end and deployed it on a web server using PostgreSQL to store player data. The project was really fun, as it combined my love for gaming with my interest in AI and programming. Seeing the chatbot come to life and receiving feedback from gamers who were thrilled with the assistance it provided was an incredible feeling! It was a great exercise in problem-solving and helped me grow both technically and creatively. I'm thrilled to share that I'm super excited to be working on developing cutting-edge robotic process automation solutions that can make a significant impact in the Fintech industry. My dream is to design a scalable AI-powered platform that can streamline financial processes, detect fraudulent activities, and improve the overall customer experience. I envision this technology being used globally, empowering small and medium-sized enterprises to compete with larger corporations. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm confident that my passion for innovation and perseverance will help me achieve it.
