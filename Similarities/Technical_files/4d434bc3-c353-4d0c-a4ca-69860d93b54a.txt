One project that comes to mind is a simple e-commerce website I built with a friend during my summer break. We used HTML and CSS to create the front-end, and it was so cool to see our design come to life! We wanted to make an online store for our favorite indie game developers, and it was amazing to see the process from scratch to finish. We learned so much from each other and had a blast while working on it. It was my first real-world project, and it gave me confidence in my coding abilities. I'm thrilled to envision the next decade and I'm convinced that Education and Technology will converge in ways that will shape the future of learning. Imagine schools and universities having dedicated virtual reality platforms, where students can take immersive field trips to historical sites, explore remote learning hubs, or participate in interactive STEM experiments. I'd love to be part of creating innovative, gamified educational platforms that make learning a fun, collaborative, and accessible experience. Can you imagine? The possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to dive in and learn more about the potential applications!
