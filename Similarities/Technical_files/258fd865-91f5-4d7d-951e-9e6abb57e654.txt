One project that really stood out to me was creating a simple web scraper using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape recipe data from a food website. I enjoyed working on it because it allowed me to combine my interest in culinary arts with my programming skills. I was able to set up a pipeline to extract and process the data, and then visualize it using Tableau. It was a small project, but it was a great way for me to practice my skills and see the output of my work come together. It was also super satisfying to be able to scrape a bunch of recipes and now have a dataset of my own! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of more inclusive and accessible augmented reality (AR) experiences that can be used in various settings, such as education, healthcare, or even entertainment. Imagine having the ability to merge the digital and physical worlds in ways that enhance our interactions, boost emotional intelligence, and foster deeper connections. This vision drives me to explore the creative possibilities of AR and its potential to shape a more empathetic and harmonious society.
