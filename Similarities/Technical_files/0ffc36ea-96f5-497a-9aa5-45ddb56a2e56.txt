I once worked on a non-technical project called Urban Odyssey - a indie game dev project with friends where we designed a puzzle-adventure game set in a futuristic, futuristic city. My role was to handle art and sound design using Figma and GarageBand respectively. I loved how it brought my creative side into play and allowed me to think outside the coding sphere. Seeing the game come to life with animations and sound effects was super fulfilling! The best part? I got to play a totally different role from my usual coding avatar. It was a blast, and I'm eager to revisit the project! I'm ecstatic to think about the projects that await us in the next decade. As an enthusiast of IoT and blockchain, I'm eager to see the development of smart cities powered by decentralized infrastructure. Imagine a world where cities have their own blockchain-based economy, facilitating seamless transactions and efficient resource allocation. I'd love to contribute to creating this future by designing innovative IoT solutions that integrate with blockchain technology. The prospect of revolutionizing urban living with cutting-edge technology is exhilarating, and I'm confident that the datathon will help me hone the skills necessary to make it a reality.
