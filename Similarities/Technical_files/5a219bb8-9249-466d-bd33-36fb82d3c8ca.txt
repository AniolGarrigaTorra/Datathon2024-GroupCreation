One project that I absolutely loved working on was a voice-assisted meditation app that I built using React Native and PyTorch. I've always been fascinated by the potential of AI in health and wellness, so this project allowed me to explore that interest. I created a user interface using Figma and then built a deep learning model using PyTorch that could analyze the user's voice to detect signs of stress and anxiety. The end result was a personalized meditation experience that really helped me relax and unwind - and it was so cool to see it come to life! I'm thrilled to think about what I'll be working on in the next decade! As someone fascinated by the potential of AI and voice skills, I'd love to contribute to the development of virtual assistants that can genuinely enhance people's daily lives. Imagine a system that can detect and respond to emotional cues, providing tailored support for mental health and wellness. My dream project would involve merging natural language processing with computer vision to create an intuitive, multimodal interface that lets people interact with their personal assistants in a more lifelike and empowering way.
