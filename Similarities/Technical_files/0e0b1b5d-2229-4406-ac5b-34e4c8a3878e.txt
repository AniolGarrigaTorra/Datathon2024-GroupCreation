I loved working on a personal project - a mobile app that helps people track their daily water intake and offers personalized reminders to stay hydrated. I learned a ton about building a functioning app from scratch, from designing the UI to implementing a backend database using Firebase. It was exhilarating to see my idea come to life and receive feedback from friends and family who appreciated the app's simplicity and usefulness. What a thrilling question! I'm ecstatic to share that I'm eager to work on something that revolutionizes the way we approach healthcare. I envision developing an AI-powered system that integrates machine learning, AR/VR, and mobile technology to provide personalized mental wellness services. This innovative platform would offer tailored therapy sessions, gamified coping mechanisms, and remote monitoring. I'm convinced that such a system could drastically improve access to quality mental healthcare, reduce stigma, and save countless lives. The prospect of making a real difference in people's lives is what gets me pumped about the next 10 years!
