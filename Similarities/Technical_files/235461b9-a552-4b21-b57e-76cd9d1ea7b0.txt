I had an absolute blast working on a solo project to develop a mobile app using Python and PyTorch for real-time object detection using a drone's camera! It was my first foray into mobile development, and I was thrilled to learn about iOS development. I designed the UI using Figma and built the app using Flask. The challenge was creating a seamless integration between the drone's camera feed and the AI-powered object detection. Seeing the app come to life and successfully detecting objects was incredibly satisfying! It was a great exercise in creative problem-solving and experimentation. The future is thrilling! I'm most excited to see the further development of immersive technologies like AR and VR. As someone who's already been experimenting with them, I envision a world where these technologies are seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. Imagine walking into a meeting room and being instantly transported into a 3D environment that feels more real than reality itself. I hope to play a role in shaping this future by combining my interests in design, RPA, and machine learning to create innovative solutions that transform the way we live, work, and interact. The possibilities are endless!
