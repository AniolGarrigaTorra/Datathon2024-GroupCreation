One project that comes to mind is a social media campaign I created during a previous hackathon. I built a platform that aimed to connect students with mental health resources on campus. I designed the UI/UX and developed the backend in Python using Flask. I also collaborated with a team to create a series of engaging social media posts to raise awareness about mental health. Seeing the impact it had on our campus community was incredibly fulfilling. It's projects like these that remind me why I love working on projects that can make a difference. As a student with a passion for social good, I'm excited to work on projects that address pressing healthcare issues. In the next 10 years, I envision developing AI-powered decision support systems that help doctors diagnose and treat diseases more accurately. I'd love to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze medical records and identify patterns, thereby improving patient outcomes. With my programming skills in PyTorch, I'm confident that I can make a meaningful impact in this space. The prospect of revolutionizing healthcare and saving lives is what drives me, and I'm excited to tackle this challenge in the years to come.
