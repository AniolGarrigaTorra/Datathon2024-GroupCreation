I'm really proud of a project I worked on last year, creating a virtual event planner for a friend's wedding. It was super fun because I got to combine my skills in web development and design. I built the app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and then designed the UI/UX to make it easy to plan and manage the event details. The coolest part was watching the couple's reactions when they saw the final product! It was my first time building a web app from scratch, and I loved seeing the impact it had on my friend's special day. I'm thrilled to think about the opportunities on the horizon! In the next 10 years, I'd love to make a significant impact in the field of healthcare. Specifically, I'm fascinated by the potential of AI-powered assistive technology to improve patient care and enhance the lives of individuals living with chronic illnesses. With my background in computer vision and NLP, I envision creating systems that empower patients to better manage their conditions, connect with healthcare professionals, and ultimately achieve better outcomes. It's an ambitious goal, but one that I believe can bring significant value to people's lives, and I'm excited to explore the possibilities.
