I had a blast working on a group project in my web development class, where we built a simple online portfolio platform using Figma, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. We designed a modern and responsive UI, and I got to contribute to implementing animations and effects to make the site more engaging. Seeing our idea come to life and working collaboratively with my teammates was incredibly fulfilling. It was also an opportunity for me to learn about design principles, user experience, and version control. I'm thrilled to share that I'm super stoked about building a decentralized, AI-powered virtual museum experience that utilizes blockchain technology and machine learning to democratize access to art and cultural heritage. The concept, titled Echoes of the Past, aims to provide a immersive, 3D reconstruction of historical landmarks and artifacts, bridging the gap between technology and art. I envision a future where users can engage with the virtual museum, contributing to the collective preservation of cultural knowledge and sparking meaningful connections across the globe. It's a bold dream, but I'm eager to make it a reality!
