I had a blast working on a non-technical project with friends, building a community center in our local neighborhood! We designed the space to promote artistic expression and self-expression. I loved seeing people come together to share their talents and create a safe space for underprivileged youth. We held workshops, art exhibitions, and even a mini-concert. As a programmer, it was a change of pace to focus on problem-solving in a more creative, less technical way. But still, I used my organizational skills learned through agile methodology to plan and coordinate the whole project. It was an incredible experience! As I look to the future, I'm thrilled to share that I'm excited about the prospect of developing an AI-powered platform that revolutionizes the way we shop sustainably. With a passion for e-commerce and social good, I envision creating a system that helps consumers make informed, eco-friendly purchasing decisions. The platform would leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze consumer habits, supply chain transparency, and product lifecycle to provide personalized recommendations, promoting a more responsible and waste-reducing consumption. This endeavor not only aligns with my values but also offers the potential to create positive environmental change.
