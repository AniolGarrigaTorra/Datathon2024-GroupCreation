I recently worked on a project that really stood out to me - building a conversational chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and React Native. I designed the chatbot's UI with Figma and developed its functionality using TensorFlow. The project allowed me to explore the intersection of NLP and programming, which I find fascinating. I enjoyed how the project allowed me to combine my technical skills with creativity, making it a well-rounded and engaging experience. Seeing my chatbot come to life and hearing feedback from others has been incredibly rewarding! I'm thrilled to think about what I'll be working on in the next 10 years! With my passion for Blockchain and Quantum, I'm eager to explore how these technologies can be integrated to create a more secure and transparent system. My dream project is to develop a quantum-resistant Blockchain protocol that enables seamless data sharing and collaboration across industries, revolutionizing the way we store and process sensitive information. Can you imagine a world where information is free-flowing and secure, and I'm excited to be a part of shaping that future!
