I recently worked on a project to visualize the growth of a local library's book collection over the past decade using D3.js. I collected the data from the library's database and used MongoDB to store and manage it. Then, I used Figma to design an interactive dashboard that shows the evolution of the collection by genre, author, and publication year. It was fascinating to see how the library's collection has diversified and grown over time! It was a fun project that challenged me to think creatively about data visualization and programming. I loved seeing the finished product come together. I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I hope to make a meaningful impact in the education sector through the application of technology. I'd like to design and develop a cutting-edge AI-powered adaptive learning platform that empowers educators to create personalized learning paths for students. This platform would utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze student performance, identifying areas where they need extra attention, and provide targeted interventions. My vision is to see this platform revolutionize the way students learn, helping them reach their full potential and bridging the educational gap worldwide.
