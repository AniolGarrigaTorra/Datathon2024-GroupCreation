I loved working on a tech project that I started back in my first year of college - a voice-controlled jar organizer! It was super fun and challenging, and I got to use my React skills to build the UI and IoT to connect it to a smart speaker. I set out to make it easy to grab my favorite snacks from the pantry, and I successfully linked the system to recognize voice commands, move the jars, and play a fun little animation when it's done! Seeing it work was so satisfying, and I'm planning to upgrade it with Machine Learning to learn and adapt. I'm super stoked about the prospect of developing an AI-powered, voice-controlled education platform that integrates augmented reality (AR) and machine learning (ML) to create an immersive learning experience. The platform would allow students to access a wealth of educational content, track their progress, and even receive personalized feedback and guidance. I envision students being able to download skills or knowledge into their minds like a video game, accelerating their learning curve and breaking down cognitive barriers. The potential to revolutionize education and empower individuals with endless learning possibilities is an electrifying prospect!
