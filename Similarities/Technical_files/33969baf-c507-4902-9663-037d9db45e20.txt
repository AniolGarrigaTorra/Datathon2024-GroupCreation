I had a blast working on a personal project where I designed and built a mobile app using Flutter to help people track their mental health and wellness. I used NLP to enable users to journal their emotions and thoughts, and then generated a mood-based playlist to help them relax. I integrated the app with Google Calendar to encourage healthy habits and mindful moments. It was fulfilling to see how my coding skills could positively impact people's lives. Plus, it was a great way to test my skills in a non-academic setting - I even got to design the UI/UX myself! What gets me stoked is the idea of developing an AI-powered chatbot that helps people with mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression. I'd love to create an intelligent system that can detect subtle cues and empathize with users, offering personalized support and resources. I'm excited to leverage my NLP skills in Java and work with databases to collect and analyze mental health data. My vision is for this chatbot to democratize access to mental healthcare, especially in underserved communities, and become a game-changer in the way we address mental wellness.
