I once worked on a personal project that blended my interests in Health and Social Good. I built a web application using Flask and Docker that helps match individuals with mental health resources in their area. It was an arduous but rewarding experience, as I had to research mental health hotlines, hospitals, and therapy centers to create a comprehensive database. Seeing the application come together and knowing I was creating something that could make a positive impact on people's lives was incredible. It sparked my passion for working on projects that make a difference in my community. What gets me genuinely excited is the prospect of developing innovative healthcare solutions using AR and AI. Imagine a world where medical professionals can access remote patients' records and vital signs in real-time, thanks to a seamless integration of AR/VR and blockchain technology. I'd love to be part of a team that creates a user-friendly platform that simplifies diagnoses, streamlines treatment plans, and connects patients with top experts worldwide. The potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, reduce healthcare costs, and save countless lives is incredibly motivating and inspires me to push the boundaries of what's possible in the next decade.
