I had so much fun working on a personal project to create a mobile app for a music festival! I'm an avid music lover, and I noticed that there wasn't an app that allowed users to create custom playlists for their favorite artists or bands. I decided to tackle the challenge and built an app using Flutter and AWS. I learned so much from the experience, from designing the user interface to deploying the app on the app stores. It was rewarding to see users enjoying the app and even submitting suggestions for future updates. It was a blast from start to finish! As I look ahead, I'm thrilled to envision a future where AI-powered personalized learning platforms revolutionize the way we acquire new skills. With my passion for education and programming, I'd love to develop a cutting-edge platform that utilizes machine learning to craft bespoke learning trajectories for students. Imagine a world where students are empowered to learn at their own pace, receiving real-time feedback and adaptive challenges to foster a deeper understanding of complex subjects. By merging education and tech, I believe we can transform the way we learn and push the boundaries of human potential.
