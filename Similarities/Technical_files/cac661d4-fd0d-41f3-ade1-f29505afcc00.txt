I had a blast working on a mobile app project in Flutter to track and share hiking trails with friends. As an outdoor enthusiast, I loved combining my passion with programming skills to create a seamless user experience. I designed the UI/UX, implemented trail mapping and sharing features, and even integrated GPS tracking. Seeing my friends enjoy the app and getting feedback on how it helped plan their hikes made all the hard work worth it. It was amazing to see how my technical skills could bring people together to share their love for nature. As a student with a passion for Fintech and IoT, I'm excited to see what the future holds. In the next 10 years, I dream of revolutionizing personal financial management with a cutting-edge AI-powered mobile app. My vision is to create a platform that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze users' spending habits, provide real-time budgeting recommendations, and help them make data-driven investment decisions. With IoT connectivity, it'll also integrate with smart devices to automatically track expenses and even make payments. My app will empower people to take control of their financial futures and achieve long-term financial stability.
