Oh, I'm super stoked to share with you a project I loved working on! It was a mobile app I created during a Hackathon with friends last year. We built an app that helps people with hearing impairments identify and learn American Sign Language (ASL) signs for common words and phrases. I was responsible for the backend, using Flask and TensorFlow for the computer vision aspect, which was a blast! Seeing people's faces light up when they learned a new sign or could communicate with others was truly rewarding. It was an amazing feeling knowing we created something that made a positive impact. What's thrilling to me is the prospect of using AI-driven computer vision to revolutionize healthcare. Imagine a world where wearable devices can detect early signs of chronic diseases, or smart glasses can assist doctors in diagnosing patients more accurately. I'd love to contribute to a platform that streamlines medical imaging analysis, allowing medical professionals to spend more time what matters most - human connection and care. It's not just about the tech; it's about transforming people's lives. I'm stoked to collaborate with fellow innovators to bring this vision to life and make a meaningful impact.
