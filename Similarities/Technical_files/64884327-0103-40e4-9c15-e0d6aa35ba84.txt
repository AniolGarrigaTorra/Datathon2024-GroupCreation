I loved working on my senior design project, a mobile app that used natural language processing to translate for language-impaired individuals! As part of the project, I got to collaborate with a team of fellow students from diverse backgrounds, from computer science to psychology. We explored various NLP libraries and implemented a custom machine learning model to improve translation accuracy. Seeing the impact of our project on people's daily lives was incredible. It was an awesome experience that taught me valuable skills in team management, project planning, and - of course - programming! As a student, I've always been fascinated by the potential of technology to revolutionize the way we live and interact with each other. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing artificial intelligence-powered prosthetics that can adapt to a person's needs and abilities in real-time. Imagine a world where someone who's lost a limb has the ability to live life to the fullest, without limitations or constraints. This project combines my interests in AI, machine learning, and IoT, and I believe it has the potential to change the lives of millions of people.
