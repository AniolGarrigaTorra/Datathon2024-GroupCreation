I recently worked on a non-technical project that I loved - creating an AR mural in our college's courtyard! As a music lover, I wanted to bring some vibrancy to our campus. I designed the mural with geometric shapes and patterns that change colors and patterns based on music beats. It was a blast collaborating with my friends from the art department to bring the concept to life. Seeing students interact with the mural, jamming out to their favorite tunes, made it all worth it. It was an incredible fusion of art, music, and community - I felt so proud to have been a part of it! I'm thrilled about the prospect of contributing to the development of an intelligent audio wearable that utilizes AR/VR technology to enhance music experiences for visually impaired individuals. As a communication major with a passion for music and art, I believe that this project could revolutionize the way people with visual impairments enjoy music and explore the world around them. With my existing knowledge of programming languages like Go and Blockchain, I'm excited to explore innovative ways to utilize AI and sensor technology to create a seamless and accessible music experience for all.
