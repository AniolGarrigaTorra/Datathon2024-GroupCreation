I had so much fun working on a data visualization project in my Introduction to Data Analysis course! We were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard to display US weather data using D3.js. I decided to get a bit creative and built a dashboard that displayed real-time weather data using API calls, and even added a feature that allowed users to input their zip code to get personalized weather updates. Seeing my project come to life and being able to share it with my peers was such a rush! As I look to the future, I'm thrilled to envision working on developing AI-powered education platforms that revolutionize the way we learn. Imagine personalized curricula tailored to each individual's learning style, skill level, and interests, making education more accessible and effective. I'd like to contribute to creating cutting-edge technology that uses machine learning algorithms to identify knowledge gaps and provide targeted support, ultimately leading to a more just and equitable education system. It's an ambitious goal, but I believe that combining my passion for coding, data analysis, and education can have a transformative impact on the world.
