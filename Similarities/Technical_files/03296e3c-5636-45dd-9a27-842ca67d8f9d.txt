I recently worked on a project to develop a mobile app using Flutter to help people with visual impairments navigate their surroundings. I was excited to combine my interests in design and health to create a solution that could make a real difference. The app used machine learning algorithms to identify objects and obstacles, and provided voice cues to guide users. I enjoyed the process of collaborating with a designer and learning about the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals. Seeing the app come to life was an incredible feeling, and I was motivated to continue refining it to make it even more effective. I'm thrilled to share my passion project with you! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on a sustainable healthcare platform that utilizes AI and quantum computing to enable personalized medical treatments for underprivileged communities. I envision a platform that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze medical records and genetic data, providing targeted treatment plans that reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. By leveraging voice skills and natural language processing, patients can receive guidance and support in their native language, empowering them to take charge of their health. It's a lofty goal, but I'm eager to make it a reality!
