I'm really proud of this one! In my high school days, I created a simple music visualization project using Python and Flutter. I gathered music data from a API and used it to create a cool visualizer that displayed a color spectrum responding to the music's beats and rhythms. It was a blast seeing it come to life! I didn't even know much about audio processing back then, but I loved experimenting and learning. My friends and family loved the end result, and I showed it off at a local coding competition, which was super motivating. It sparked my interest in IoT and AI/ML, too! I'm really excited about the potential of using AI and machine learning to revolutionize the way we communicate. I dream of creating a platform that uses natural language processing and computer vision to help deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals communicate more easily and independently. I envision an app that allows users to sign, type, or speak, and then translate that input into a visual representation that can be understood by others. It would also have features like language identification and sentence construction to help facilitate richer conversations. The possibilities are endless, and I hope to be a part of making this technology a reality!
