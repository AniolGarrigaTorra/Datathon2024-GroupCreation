I recently worked on a project to develop a chatbot that helps high school students manage their study habits and track their progress. I used TensorFlow to build the AI model and connected it to a MongoDB database. It was a blast to learn how to design and implement the chatbot's conversational flow using React Native. Seeing students interacting with the chatbot and getting feedback on their improved study habits was really rewarding. I even got to do some Android development to create a mobile app that allowed students to access the chatbot on-the-go! I'm thrilled to think about the future! As someone with a passion for Education and Productivity, I'd love to contribute to the development of AI-powered virtual tutors that can help bridge the educational gap for underprivileged students. I envision a platform that uses machine learning to create personalized learning plans, tracks progress, and provides real-time feedback. With my background in programming and interest in Machine Learning, I'm eager to learn more about NLP and computer vision to make this vision a reality. The idea of using tech to democratize access to quality education is truly exciting and fulfilling!
