One of my favorite projects was creating a web-based portfolio platform using React, HTML/CSS, and Figma. I built it as part of a university project, where I worked as a solo developer to design and implement the UI/UX, backend, and front-end development. I enjoyed the challenge of translating a client's needs into a working prototype, and I loved learning new design principles and libraries like Figma. Seeing it come to life was an amazing feeling! Plus, I learned a ton about project management, time estimation, and the importance of having a clear wireframe - it was an awesome experience! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to be part of a team developing a conversational AI-powered retail platform that integrates physical and online shopping experiences. Imagine walking into a store, and being greeted by a personalized AI concierge that knows your purchase history and preferences. As you browse, the AI suggests matching products, offers recommendations, and even allows for virtual try-on. The goal is to revolutionize the retail industry by creating a seamless, immersive experience that bridges the gap between online and offline shopping. Can't wait to see this become a reality!
