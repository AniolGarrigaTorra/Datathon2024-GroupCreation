I absolutely loved working on a Flutter app project where I designed and developed a food delivery platform for local restaurants. It was my senior project in college, and I had the opportunity to learn about UX/UI design, full-stack development, and agile project management. I enjoyed the creative freedom to decide on the app's features and layout, and it was thrilling to see it come to life. I gained valuable skills and experience, and it was an incredible feeling to share the app with friends and family, who loved using it! I'm absolutely stoked about the prospect of contributing to the development of sustainable and accessible financial solutions. As someone with a passion for Fintech, I dream of creating a user-friendly mobile app that enables underserved communities to access crucial financial services, such as microloans, savings platforms, and digital payment systems. In the next 10 years, I envision a world where technology has bridged the financial gap, empowering marginalized individuals to break free from poverty cycles and achieve economic stability. It's a lofty goal, but one that I believe can make a tangible difference in people's lives.
