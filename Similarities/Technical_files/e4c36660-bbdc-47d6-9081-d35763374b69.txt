I had a blast working on a project where I built a music recommender system using TensorFlow and Android Development! I've always been passionate about music and wanted to combine my interest in machine learning with my passion for music. The project involved training a neural network on a dataset of user behavior and song characteristics to predict personalized music recommendations. Seeing users enjoy the recommendations I'd worked so hard to create was incredibly fulfilling. It was an amazing feeling to see my code come to life and make a tangible impact on people's lives. It was definitely a project that I'll always treasure! I'm thrilled to be working on a project that combines my passion for design, quantum computing, and social good. I envision developing an AI-powered, blockchain-secured platform that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict community needs, and then provides personalized recommendations for local resources, social services, and educational opportunities. This platform would also integrate voice assistants to make it accessible to everyone, regardless of language or ability. In the next 10 years, I aim to see this platform empower underserved communities worldwide, breaking the barriers of accessibility and bridge the gap between resources and those who need them.
