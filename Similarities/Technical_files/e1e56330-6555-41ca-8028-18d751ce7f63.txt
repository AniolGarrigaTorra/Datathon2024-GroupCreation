One project that I absolutely loved working on was a personal blog site I built using Flask and HTML/CSS. I designed the UI/UX using Materialize and Figma, and implemented a custom admin panel for content management using SQLAlchemy. What made this project so enjoyable was the sense of creative freedom and the ability to learn something new. I didn't have a strict goal or deadline, so I could work on it in small increments whenever I wanted. It was a great way to practice my web development skills and have something to show off when friends and family asked me to make their own websites. I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of exploring the intersection of AI, blockchain, and education. I envision a future where personal learning management systems are secured by blockchain and powered by AI-driven recommendation engines. Students would have a customized learning journey, with adaptive assessments and real-time feedback. It's a concept I'm already tinkering with, and I'd love to bring it to life during this datathon or in the years to come. Can you imagine it? Students able to unlock their full potential, and educators having a more streamlined way of measuring progress? That's my moonshot goal!
