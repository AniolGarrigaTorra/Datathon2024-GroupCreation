I had a blast working on a tech project called Smart Home Hub during my freshman year. It was a web app that used Blockchain and smart contract technology to securely store and manage IoT devices. I worked on the frontend with Flutter, implementing data visualization and user interface design. It was an amazing opportunity to combine my interests in technology, blockchain, and IoT! Plus, it was my first experience working on a project that had real-world potential, and it really showed me the impact coding can have on people's daily lives. What an exhilarating thought! Over the next decade, I'm thrilled to tackle a project that fusionates my passions for AI, Blockchain, and Data Visualization. I envision building a platform that utilizes machine learning and Blockchain to monitor and predict environmental sustainability indices, such as air and water quality, in real-time. My platform, dubbed EcoPulse, would utilize smart contracts to facilitate community-driven data collection, ensuring the data is accurate, trustworthy, and accessible to the public. By democratizing access to environmental data, I hope to inspire collective action and accelerated progress toward a cleaner, healthier planet.
