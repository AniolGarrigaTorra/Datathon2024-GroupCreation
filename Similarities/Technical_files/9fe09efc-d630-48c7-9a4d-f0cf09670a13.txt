I once built a personal project where I created a VR experience using Unity and Rust to explore a 3D-generated cave system. I was thrilled to see my cave come to life with textures, lighting, and sound effects! I spent hours experimenting with different algorithms to generate the cave structure and create a sense of exploration. Non-technical friends were amazed by the experience, and I realized the magic of combining art and coding. Although it's not production-ready, the project instilled confidence in my problem-solving abilities and fueled my passion for combining tech and creativity. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about creating immersive healthcare experiences using AR/VR technology! As a tech-savvy individual, I envision a future where patients can receive more personalized and engaging treatments, allowing for better diagnoses and outcomes. Imagine patients virtually walking through a digital replica of their body to identify issues or undergoing immersive therapy sessions that make them feel more in control. My ultimate goal is to develop a platform that empowers healthcare professionals to create custom AR/VR experiences, making a tangible impact on patient care and improving overall health outcomes.
