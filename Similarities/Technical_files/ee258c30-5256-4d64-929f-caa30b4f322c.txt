I had an absolute blast working on a virtual reality chat room for my gaming community. I'd never explored VR dev before, so it was a total hack-and-learn experience. I used PyTorch to build the neural network for text-to-speech synthesis, and Flutter to create the UI. It was amazing to see my community jump into VR and chat with each other like never before. I even got to design some sweet UX bits, like interactive avatars and mini-games. It was a massive learning curve, but the sense of achievement when it came together was incredible! I'm super stoked about the prospect of contributing to the development of voice-assisted education systems. With my passion for UI/UX design and AI capabilities, I envision a future where voice technology becomes an integral tool for personalized learning and skill-building. Imagine being able to converse with AI-powered chatbots that assist and adapt to your learning needs, providing individualized feedback and guidance. I'd love to be part of a project that leverages the potential of voice AI for global education, making high-quality learning accessible to underserved communities and changing the face of education as we know it.
