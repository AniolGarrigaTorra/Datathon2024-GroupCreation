I loved working on a mobile app development project during my college hackathon. Our team created an accessible gaming platform for visually impaired students. We utilized Android development and React Native to design an immersive gaming experience using AI-powered audio feedback. It was incredible to see how technology could positively impact someone's life. I contributed to the development of the app, learning new skills along the way. Seeing the app's impact on the students who used it was incredibly fulfilling. It's moments like those that drive me to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology and data. I'm absolutely stoked to contribute to creating an AI-powered, blockchain-secured, mobile-first edTech platform that personalizes education for underprivileged kids worldwide. Imagine a system that uses Machine Learning to analyze individual learning patterns, adapting curriculum and instruction in real-time to ensure no one gets left behind. My dream is to create a decentralized, community-driven platform that breaks financial barriers and enables equal access to quality education. The technology exists, and I'm excited to harness my skills in programming and data analysis to make a lasting impact on the lives of millions of children worldwide.
