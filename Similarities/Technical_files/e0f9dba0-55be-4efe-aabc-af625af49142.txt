I had an absolute blast working on a computer vision project where I built a pet-friendly selfie app. Using TensorFlow, I trained a model to detect and recognize my pet dog's facial expressions. The goal was to create an AR experience where users could overlay fun animations onto their pup's face. From setting up the dataset to deploying the app, it was an incredible learning experience. Seeing my furry friends having fun with the app was the ultimate reward. It was an amazing feeling knowing that I not only improved my coding skills but also created something genuinely amusing for pet lovers. What a thrilling thought! In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on developing a personal artificial intelligence assistant that utilizes my passion for machine learning and computer vision to revolutionize daily life. I envision an AI companion that, with mere hand gestures, can anticipate and cater to one's needs, from sending smart replies to controlling smart home devices. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that amplifies human abilities, making our daily routines smoother and more enjoyable. Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll have AI assistants that can help us achieve more with less effort and create a brighter future.
