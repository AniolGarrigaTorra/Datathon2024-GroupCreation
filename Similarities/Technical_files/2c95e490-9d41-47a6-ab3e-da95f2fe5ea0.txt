I've been working on a music recommendation system as a project to learn more about machine learning! It's been a blast, and I've loved exploring how I can use music to make a positive impact. I used a combination of TypeScript and a library I found online to scrape song features from various APIs and train a model to recommend songs based on users' preferences. It's been amazing to see the system learn and adapt as I've fed it more data. It's also been great to work with music, as it's something I'm so passionate about - I love how it brings people together! I'm thrilled to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, environmental sustainability, and social justice. In the next decade, I envision working on projects that leverage machine learning to develop AI-powered tools that detect and predict natural disasters, climate-related threats, and disease outbreaks. I'd love to create sustainable, decentralized networks that integrate data from IoT sensors, social media, and satellite imaging to empower underserved communities with timely, actionable insights. By doing so, I aim to contribute to a future where technology fosters resilience, adaptability, and collective growth towards a more equitable, environmentally conscious world.
