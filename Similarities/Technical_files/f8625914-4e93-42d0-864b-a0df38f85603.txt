I had a blast working on a passion project that combined my love for music and coding. I built a mobile app that used machine learning to generate personalized song playlists based on users' emotional state. I used Java for the backend and Figma for the UI/UX design. The app used Azure for its architecture, and I even created a custom WordPress plugin for easy song data storage. Seeing users' reactions when they received their tailored playlists was incredibly rewarding. It was an incredible feeling to know that I had created something that brought joy to others! What a thrilling question! In the next decade, I'm thrilled to delve into the realm of conversational AI and voice-assisted technologies. I envision myself creating seamless integrations between voice skills and user experiences, making it a staple in our daily lives. I'd love to co-create a smart shopping companion, where AI-driven fashion recommendations would curate personalized outfits based on a customer's wardrobe, style, and preferences. The thrill lies in redefining the way we interact with products, leveraging machine learning and UI/UX design to make life more effortless, exciting, and memorable.
