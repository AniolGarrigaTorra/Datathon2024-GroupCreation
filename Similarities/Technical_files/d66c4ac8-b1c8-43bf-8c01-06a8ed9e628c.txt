One project that stands out is an AR painting app I built with a friend last semester. We were both art lovers, and I'd never explored AR before, so it was a thrill to dive in and learn. We used iOS development, Core Animation, and the ARKit to create an interactive app that transformed users' surroundings into a canvas. It was awesome to see people's reactions when they saw their paintings come to life! We had so much fun testing and iterating, and I loved the creative freedom of working on something entirely new. It's still a favorite side project of mine! I'm super stoked about the prospect of developing an innovative AR/VR app that enables people to visualize and interact with abstract complex data concepts, like quantum mechanics and machine learning algorithms, in a engaging and immersive way. Just think about it - being able to manipulate 3D models of particle interactions or exploring the intricacies of neural networks as if you were right there in the program! It's an incredible opportunity to make complex data more accessible and understandable, and I can't wait to collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts to bring this vision to life.
