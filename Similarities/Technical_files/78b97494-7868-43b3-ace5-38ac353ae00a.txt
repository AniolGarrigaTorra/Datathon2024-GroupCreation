I absolutely loved working on a personal project where I built a habit tracker app using PyTorch and Figma. I'm a big fan of productivity, and I wanted to create something that would help me stay focused on my goals. The app uses natural language processing to analyze my daily routines and offer customized recommendations to boost my productivity. I designed the UI/UX in Figma and implemented the backend using PyTorch. It was an amazing feeling to see my idea come to life, and I've already recommended it to my friends who share my interest in self-improvement! I'm thrilled about the prospect of contributing to a project that utilizes data science to positively impact mental health. With the increasing prevalence of mental wellness concerns among young adults, I believe AI-powered tools can be a game-changer. I envision working on a chatbot integrated with natural language processing, utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect early signs of mental health struggles and providing users with personalized resources and support. The possibility of developing such a life-changing technology keeps me up at night, and I'm excited to bring this vision to life during the datathon and beyond!
