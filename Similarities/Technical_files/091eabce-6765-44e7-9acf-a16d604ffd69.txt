I loved working on a school project to build a chatbot that could assist people with disabilities navigate around a university campus. It was a combination of my interests in health and mobility. I used Python and the TensorFlow library to develop the chatbot's language processing capabilities, and integrated it with a map-making API to provide users with accessible route suggestions. It was an exciting project because it was challenging, yet had the potential to make a real impact on people's lives. Seeing my project come to life and thinking about how it could be used in the future was really rewarding! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on a project that combines my interests in Robotics Process Automation, Healthcare, and Quantum Computing. I envision creating an AI-powered healthcare assistant that leverages robotic process automation to streamline clinical workflows, automate data analysis, and even diagnose diseases with the help of quantum computing algorithms. This assistant would have the potential to revolutionize patient care by increasing efficiency, reducing errors, and improving health outcomes. It's an ambitious goal, but I believe that my skills in programming and data analysis can make a significant impact in this area.
