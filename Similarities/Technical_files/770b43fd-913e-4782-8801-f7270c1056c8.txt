Oh yeah! One project that really stood out to me was building a chatbot for a local animal shelter using PyTorch and PostgreSQL. It was an iOS app that allowed users to adopt or volunteer with the shelter, and even integrate with Google Maps to show nearby locations. I was stoked to apply my programming skills to make a tangible impact on a cause I care about - Social Good, baby! Seeing the furry faces on my screen, responding to the chatbot's conversational UI, made all the coding nights worth it. It was a blast to work on and received a great response from the community! As a student with a passion for social good, I'm thrilled to think about the impact I can make in the next decade. I envision developing an AI-powered chatbot that assists NGOs and non-profits in efficiently managing their donor relationships, tracking fundraising campaigns, and providing personalized outreach to supporters. My goal is to create a user-friendly platform that streamlines data management, enabling these organizations to focus on their missions rather than administrative tasks. By integrating PyTorch and PostgreSQL, I'm confident I can create a game-changing solution that empowers these entities to drive real change and make a meaningful difference in the world.
