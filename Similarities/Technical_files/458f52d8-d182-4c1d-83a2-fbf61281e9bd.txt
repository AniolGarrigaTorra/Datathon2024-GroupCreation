I loved working on my personal project, a voice-controlled home automation system using Amazon Alexa and Raspberry Pi. It was a great combo of hardware and software, and I got to use my knowledge of Python and IoT to bring it to life. I set up the RPi to control lights, temperature, and security cameras using voice commands, and even added a dash of computer vision to detect and recognize objects in front of the system. Seeing it all come together and being able to control my entire home with just my voice was so satisfying! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive deeper into the realm of human-computer interaction. Imagine a world where artificial intelligence assists people with disabilities, and voice-controlled interfaces become ubiquitous. I'd love to develop a conversational AI that understands human emotions, creating a more empathetic technology. I envision AI-powered prosthetics that can adapt to an individual's needs, bridging the gap between human capabilities. By then, I hope to have contributed to breakthroughs in AI-assisted daily living, and who knows, maybe even changed the game in the process!
