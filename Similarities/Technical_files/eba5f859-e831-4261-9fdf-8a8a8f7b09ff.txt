I had an absolute blast working on a personal project combining my love for music and art with my tech skills! I created an AI-powered generative art studio using PyTorch and JavaScript, where users can input their favorite songs and watch an AI algorithm generate a stunning visual representation of the music in real-time. It was a fantastic experience merging creative vision with technical challenges. I got to explore topics like audio analysis, neural networks, and web development while bringing my artistic side to life. The project taught me so much about creative problem-solving and pushed me out of my comfort zone! As a researcher and data enthusiast, I'm thrilled to envision a world where technology converges with social impact. In the next decade, I'm eager to contribute to the development of AI-powered medical devices that detect and prevent diseases more effectively, reducing healthcare disparities globally. Specifically, I'd love to create an augmented reality system that enables early detection of hearing loss and language development issues in children. Combining my expertise in AI, healthcare, and music therapy, I aim to create a more accessible and equitable society through the harmonious fusion of technology, medicine, and creative expression.
