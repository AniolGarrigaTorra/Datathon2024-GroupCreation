I loved working on a personal project where I created a mobile app to track and reduce food waste for friends and family. I built the app using Flutter, connecting it to a web-based dashboard using Flask. It was amazing to see it come together! I loved the intersection of social good, tech, and design. I got to experiment with different data visualization techniques and implemented a simple machine learning algorithm to predict expiration dates. It was a blast to share it with friends and see how they benefited from using it. I'm super stoked to dive into developing innovative AI-powered mental health apps! As someone who's passionate about tech for social good, I've always been fascinated by the potential of AI to revolutionize the way we approach mental wellness. In the next decade, I dream of creating an empathetic chatbot that uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized support to people struggling with mental health issues. With a robust backend on cloud platforms and a user-friendly interface, I envision an app that seamlessly integrates with wearable devices and mental health services to offer a comprehensive support system. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm up for the challenge!
