I loved working on a personal project where I built a chatbot using Rust and TensorFlow to help users manage their day-to-day tasks and reminders. I used AWS Alexa as the voice interface, which was a new experience for me. I enjoyed the challenge of integrating AI and natural language processing to create a conversational bot. It was a fun and rewarding experience, and I saw the chatbot come to life as I tweaked and refined its language understanding and response generation. I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastically looking forward to working on a project that combines my passions for education and technology. In the next 10 years, I'm envisioning the development of an AI-powered, personalized learning platform that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide immersive, real-time educational experiences. This platform would enable students to receive tailored instruction, adapt to their learning pace, and engage with cutting-edge educational content - all while being accessible from any device. It's a prospect that excites me and drives my daily quest for innovation and excellence.
