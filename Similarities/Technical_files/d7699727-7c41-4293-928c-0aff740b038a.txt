I absolutely loved working on a Music Recommender System project as part of a student competition. It was my first major programming project, and I was thrilled to learn how to implement a machine learning algorithm using Python and TensorFlow. The goal was to create a platform that suggests music tracks based on a user's preferences. I designed the user interface with Figma, built the backend using Python, and integrated it with a music library database. Seeing the app come to life and testing it out was an incredible feeling! It was an amazing experience that showed me the impact of combining art and tech. What a thrilling thought! In the next decade, I'm absolutely psyched to dive into developing AI-powered educational platforms that merge blockchain and machine learning. Imagine a world where children can safely explore and learn critical skills like cybersecurity and coding through immersive, interactive simulations. As someone who's passionate about education, I believe technology can democratize access to knowledge and empower the next generation of innovators. If I can play a part in shaping this future, I'll be honored.
