I had a blast working on a non-technical project - creating a wellness planner using Figma! I've always been interested in design and found it super relaxing to explore Figma's features. I made a planner with different sections for tracking habits, journaling, and goal setting. I also added some custom illustrations and icons to give it a personal touch. Seeing the planner come together and hearing friends say it was so cute made it a really fulfilling project. Plus, it's been great to start using it in my daily routine! I'm thrilled about the prospect of making a significant impact in the world of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. In the next 10 years, I envision working on a project that leverages AI and blockchain to revolutionize supply chain management and make it more transparent, secure, and efficient. My dream is to develop a platform that allows companies to track their products in real-time, reducing counterfeiting and increasing consumer confidence. I'm also interested in exploring the potential of decentralized apps and smart contracts to democratize access to resources and create a more equitable society.
