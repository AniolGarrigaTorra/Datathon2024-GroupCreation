I loved working on a personal project to develop an Android app that helped students in my university navigate the campus and find resources more efficiently. As a computer science major, I wanted to create something practical that could make a difference in my daily life. The project was challenging, but seeing the app come to life and receiving positive feedback from fellow students made it all worth it. I even added a feature to share availability of common spaces, which was super useful during exam periods. It was an amazing feeling to know I was creating something that could help others! I'm thrilled to think about the innovative projects I'd like to work on in the next decade. My passion for Education and Technology fusion is what gets me pumped! I envision creating an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that integrates with educational robots, allowing students to learn complex concepts in a hands-on, immersive manner. By leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning, robotics, and IoT, I believe we can democratize quality education, make it more accessible, and prepare future generations to tackle the most pressing global challenges. The idea of transforming the educational landscape through tech is what gets me excited!
