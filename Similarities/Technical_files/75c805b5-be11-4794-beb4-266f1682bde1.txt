One project that stands out to me was a social impact app I developed in university, using React and Natural Language Processing. The app helped users report and track food waste in their community. I loved working on this project because it combined my passions for social good and technology. I was able to contribute to a meaningful cause and gain valuable experience with front-end development and machine learning. Seeing the app come to life and learning about the impact it was having on local food waste was incredibly rewarding! It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to grow as a developer. I'm thrilled to think about the kind of projects I'll be working on in the next decade! As a developer with a passion for social good and health, I'd love to contribute to the development of AR/VR platforms that enable remote medical consultations and educational experiences for underprivileged communities. Imagine being able to virtually transport students to museums or historical sites, breaking down geographical barriers and making quality education more accessible. I envision myself working with cross-functional teams to design and implement immersive experiences that drive positive change and make a tangible impact on people's lives.
