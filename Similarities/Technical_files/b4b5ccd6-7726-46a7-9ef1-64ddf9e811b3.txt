I recently worked on a project to create a chatbot for a local healthcare organization using Flutter. I enjoyed the challenge of crafting conversational dialogue and integrating it with a simple database using PostgreSQL. It was my first time working with a large-scale data set, and I learned a lot about designing a user-friendly interface for non-techies. Seeing patients interacting with the chatbot and hearing their positive feedback was incredibly rewarding. It was a great opportunity to apply my technical skills to a social good project, and I'm proud to have contributed to improving patient care in my community. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about creating an AI-powered healthcare platform that leverages machine learning to provide personalized wellness recommendations and disease prevention strategies for underprivileged communities. With my skills in Flask, UI/UX design, and PostgreSQL, I envision developing a user-friendly interface that integrates patient data with relevant health insights. Furthermore, I'm fascinated by the prospect of utilizing Android and Flutter to create a mobile app that caters to diverse user experiences. My dream is to launch a non-profit organization that utilizes data analysis and ML to improve healthcare outcomes, bridging the gap for those who need it most.
