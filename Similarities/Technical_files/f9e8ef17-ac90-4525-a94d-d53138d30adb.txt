I had a blast working on a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project in college, where we created a bot that automated a tedious task for a local non-profit organization. I got to learn Python and the RPA tooling, which was a great challenge for me. Seeing the impact it had on their workflow and watching their excitement when they saw the results was incredibly fulfilling. I loved the problem-solving aspect, designing the workflow, and testing the bot. It was an amazing experience that really highlighted the value of applying tech for social good. I'm genuinely thrilled about the prospect of working on sustainable and accessible robotics projects in the next decade. I envision myself developing innovative robotic process automation systems that enable organizations to significantly reduce their environmental footprint. Imagine drones that can efficiently monitor and mitigate natural disasters, or robots that can accurately detect and sort waste in real-time. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to contribute to a future where technology serves humanity in a meaningful way. It's a challenging but achievable goal, and I'm eager to start working towards it!
