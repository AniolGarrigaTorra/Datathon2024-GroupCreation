I had an absolute blast working on a social media analytics project last semester! As part of my communications elective, our group created a dashboard using Power BI and Python to analyze the Twitter engagement of local non-profits. We scraped the tweets using Twython, applied natural language processing to extract keywords, and then visualized the results using data journalism. It was fascinating to see which topics sparked the most conversations and which hashtags increased the engagement. Our project even got featured at a university conference! I loved combining technical skills with social impact - it was an amazing collaboration. I'm thrilled to share that I'm eager to contribute to the development of more responsible and transparent AI technologies. Specifically, I hope to explore the application of machine learning in addressing social and environmental challenges, such as climate change and income inequality. I envision working on projects that combine natural language processing, computer vision, and ethics to develop AI-powered systems that can aid humanity in making more informed decisions and taking actionable steps towards a more sustainable future. It's a lofty goal, but I believe the potential impact could be immense!
