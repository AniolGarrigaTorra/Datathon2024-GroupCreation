One project that really stood out to me was a computer vision-based personal shopping assistant app I built for Android. It used object detection to identify items in a store and suggested matching products online, complete with price comparisons and reviews. I enjoyed the challenge of teaching the AI to recognize products accurately and implementing a robust algorithm to handle varying lighting conditions and angles. Seeing it come to life and actually helping someone find what they were looking for was super rewarding! I'm thrilled to share my long-term vision with you! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing an innovative education platform that utilizes AI-powered adaptive learning and gamification to make education more accessible and engaging for children worldwide. Imagine a platform that can learn and adapt to an individual child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, providing personalized learning paths and real-time feedback. I envision a future where education is democratized, and every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential, regardless of their geographical location or socioeconomic status. It's a tall order, but I believe it's achievable, and I'm eager to be a part of shaping it!
