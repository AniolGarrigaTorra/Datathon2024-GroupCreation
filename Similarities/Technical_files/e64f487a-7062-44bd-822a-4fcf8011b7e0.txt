I recently worked on a non-technical project that was really close to my heart - designing a digital planner for students! I'm a second-year student myself, and I knew how chaotic our schedules could get. I wanted to create something that would help us stay organized and focused. I spent hours designing the layout, selecting a color palette, and adding features like deadlines reminders and task tracking. It was amazing to see my ideas come to life, and I loved sharing it with my friends and getting their feedback. It was a fun and creative challenge that got me out of my coding comfort zone! As I look to the future, I'm thrilled to think about the opportunity to work on real-world problem-solving using technology. Specifically, I'm excited to contribute to the development of smart and sustainable cities through the application of Internet of Things (IoT) and DevOps principles. I envision leveraging my programming skills to design and implement smart infrastructure, such as intelligent transportation systems, efficient energy management, and green building automation. With advancements in technology and collective efforts, I believe we can create more livable, resilient, and environmentally friendly cities that prioritize the well-being of both humans and the planet.
