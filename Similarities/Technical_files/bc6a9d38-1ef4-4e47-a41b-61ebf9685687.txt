I worked on a non-technical project that combines my passions for music and art. I created a short animated music video using footage of live concerts I shot with friends. It was amazing to see how much creativity and experimentation brought it to life! I edited the clips in Adobe Premiere, added music and transitions, and even dabbled with some stop-motion animation techniques. It was awesome to express myself outside of coding and see how music and visuals can come together to create something unique. The end result was an awesome 3-minute video that we enjoyed screening at local shows. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about using data science and automation to drive social impact. In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on a project that harnesses the power of AI to detect and combat early-stage wildfires, allowing for quicker response times and minimized destruction. Imagine a system that can analyze environmental conditions, satellite imagery, and community reports to predict and prevent disasters. This dream is driven by my desire to make a tangible difference in people's lives, combining my technical skills with my values of compassion and social responsibility. The possibilities are endless!
