I had a blast working on a smart home automation project using IoT and Node.js! I set up a sensor network to track lighting, temperature, and humidity levels in my tiny apartment. I then built a web app using MongoDB and JavaScript to visualize and control the sensors in real-time. It was thrilling to see my code come to life and watch my home change color to reflect my mood (it's pretty cool to have blue lights when I'm jamming to music). This project allowed me to combine my loves of tech, design, and minimal living - and it's still rocking in my place today! I'm thrilled to share that I've been fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize industries, especially in finance and healthcare. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on creating a decentralized, AI-powered platform that utilizes IoT sensors to track medical records, prescriptions, and lab results in a secure and transparent manner. The platform would allow patients to have full control over their data, enabling them to make informed decisions and receive personalized health recommendations. This vision aligns with my passion for Fintech and Lifehacks, and I'm eager to bring it to life!
