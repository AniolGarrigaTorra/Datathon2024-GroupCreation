One project that comes to mind is a Flutter app I worked on to control my homemade robot using my Android phone. I loved the experience of bringing my IoT ideas to life! I used Bluetooth connectivity to establish a connection between my phone and the robot, and then I wrote a custom parser to understand the commands I was sending. It was thrilling to see my robot move and react to my commands. This project allowed me to combine my passion for robotics and programming, and it was amazing to see the possibilities come together. I'm thrilled to think about the potential impact I can make in the world of technology. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing innovative, AI-powered wearable devices that can remotely monitor and diagnose chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or heart disease. These devices would integrate sensors, machine learning, and IoT technology to collect real-time health data, alerting doctors to potential complications and enabling personalized treatment plans. By 2030, I envision millions of people benefiting from improved healthcare outcomes, reduced hospitalization rates, and enhanced overall well-being. This goal pushes me to continually hone my skills and stay ahead of the curve.
