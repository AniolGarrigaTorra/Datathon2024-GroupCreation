I recently worked on a technical project, building a music recommendation system using PyTorch and Natural Language Processing. I trained a neural network to analyze lyrics and generate personalized playlists based on a user's musical preferences. I enjoyed exploring the intersection of music and technology, and it was fascinating to see how machine learning can be applied to create unique music experiences. The best part was seeing the system in action, with friends and family loving the customized playlists it produced. It was an awesome feeling to see my code bring people together through music! As a PhD student with a passion for productivity and cybersecurity, I'm thrilled to think about the projects that lie ahead. In the next decade, I envision myself working on a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual secure vault, utilizing blockchain and machine learning to safeguard sensitive data and financial transactions. With my expertise in NLP, I'd be developing an intelligent chatbot to assist users in securely storing and retrieving their data. This ambitious project would require seamless integration of computer vision, Docker, and PostgreSQL - a true showcase of my coding skills. It's an exciting challenge, and I'm eager to bring it to life.
