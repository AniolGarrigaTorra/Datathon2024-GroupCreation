I absolutely loved working on a project to build a chatbot using Flutter and voice skills to help students struggling with mental health! I was introduced to it through a university club, and it was such a refreshing change from traditional programming projects. I got to combine my interests in programming, design, and social good, and work alongside some amazing people who shared similar passions. It was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding to see our bot help students in such a meaningful way. The non-technical folks involved were amazing too, sharing their expertise on mental health resources, so we could build something truly impactful. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about tackling social entrepreneurship projects that leverage data analysis and tech innovation to drive positive change. In the next decade, I envision myself working on a project that empowers underserved communities through inclusive e-commerce platforms, fostering economic mobility and sustainability. I'm excited to explore the intersection of fintech, e-commerce, and social impact, using my skills in Flutter, blockchain, and databases to create a scalable solution that benefits both the bottom line and society.
