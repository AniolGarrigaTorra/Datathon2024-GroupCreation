I'd say one of the projects that really got me stoked was a VR chatbot I worked on during my summer break. I used Java and ARCore to create an immersive gaming experience, where players could interact with their friends in a virtual environment. The best part was seeing the surprised faces on my friends when they first tried it out - they couldn't believe how real it felt! The tech was complex, but it was an incredible feeling seeing all the moving parts come together. It was definitely a challenge, but also super rewarding. I'm thrilled to think about the future and the incredible projects that are waiting for us! In the next 10 years, I'm super stoked to work on developing a revolutionary augmented reality platform that seamlessly integrates e-commerce and retail, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds. Imagine walking into a store and having the items you've been browsing online hover around you, with AR-enabled packaging providing contextual product info and promotions. My dream is to create an ecosystem where customers can effortlessly navigate online/offline shopping, and merchants can leverage data insights to create immersive shopping experiences. It's a mouthful, but I'm confident that technology can make it a reality!
