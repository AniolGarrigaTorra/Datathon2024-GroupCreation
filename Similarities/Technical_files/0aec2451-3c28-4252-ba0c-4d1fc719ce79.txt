One project that really stood out to me was a school project where I built a smart alarm clock system using Arduino and NodeMCU. I worked with a friend to create a device that could monitor and control the brightness and temperature of a room based on the user's schedule. We also incorporated voice control using AWS Lex and Alexa. I loved the hands-on approach and the satisfaction of seeing our prototype come to life. It was a great way to combine my interests in IoT, robotics, and machine learning! I'm thrilled to see advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning being utilized to improve daily lives. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on projects that merge AI with IoT and automation, enabling households to adapt and optimize their energy consumption, water usage, and waste management. Imagine smart homes that predict and adjust their systems to minimize waste and reduce carbon footprint! My goal is to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and sustainability, empowering individuals to live in harmony with the environment while enjoying the comforts of modern living.
