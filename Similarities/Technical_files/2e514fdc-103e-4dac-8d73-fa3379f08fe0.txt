I had a blast working on a machine learning-based song recommendation app in Go! I've always been a music junkie, so combining my love for music with programming was a dream come true. I used collaborative filtering and clustering algorithms to generate song suggestions based on user preferences. The app allowed users to rate songs and explore music genres they might not have known about otherwise. Seeing people enjoy discovering new artists and music was incredibly rewarding. It was a fun project that blended my interests in music and coding, and I learned a ton about machine learning and Go development! I'm thrilled about the prospect of using my skills to develop innovative solutions that can positively impact society. In the next 10 years, I envision working on a revolutionary AI-powered virtual assistant for people with disabilities. As someone who's passionate about music and art, I'd love to incorporate those aspects into the project, allowing users to express themselves through creative therapies. I'd be collaborating with experts in psychology, AI, and design to bring this concept to life. The idea excites me because I believe it has the potential to make a meaningful difference in people's lives, promoting inclusivity and creativity.
