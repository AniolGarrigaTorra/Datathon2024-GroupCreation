I've had the blast working on a voice skill project, where I created a simple smart home controller using AWS Lex and Dialogflow. It was my first venture into natural language processing, and I loved experimenting with different intents and entity recognition. I created a simple UI using React Native, and integrated it with my smart speaker to control my lights and thermostat. It was super cool seeing my code come to life and being able to chat with my own assistant! The feeling of accomplishment was addictive, and I'm already planning my next voice-enabled project. I'm thrilled to think about what I'd love to work on in the next 10 years. My ultimate passion project would be developing an AI-powered, personalized educational platform that combines blockchain security and gamification to empower students worldwide. The platform, SmartLearn, would leverage machine learning to analyze individual learning patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, providing adaptive learning pathways, rewards, and real-time feedback. I envision a world where access to quality education is equitably distributed, and every student has the opportunity to unlock their full potential. I'm excited to take small steps towards making this vision a reality, starting with what I learn here at the datathon!
