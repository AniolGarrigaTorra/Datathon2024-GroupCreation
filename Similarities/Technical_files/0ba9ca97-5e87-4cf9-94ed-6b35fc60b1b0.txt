I had an absolute blast working on a project where I built a robotic process automation (RPA) system using Python and Go programming languages! I loved learning about how I could automate tedious tasks by using software bots to interact with existing systems. The project was a great opportunity to combine my interests in design, automation, and innovation. I got to design a user-friendly interface, develop the RPA logic, and test the system's performance. It was an incredible feeling seeing the bot in action, efficiently performing tasks and freeing up human employees to focus on more creative and high-value tasks! I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I'm determined to revolutionize the way cities manage their infrastructure using data-driven approaches. I envision designing an AI-powered city management platform that integrates data analytics, IoT sensors, and blockchain technology to optimize traffic flow, reduce waste, and enhance public safety. By leveraging machine learning models trained on historical and real-time data, this platform would enable cities to predict and proactively address emerging issues, promoting a more sustainable, efficient, and livable urban environment.
