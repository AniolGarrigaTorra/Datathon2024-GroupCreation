I'm really passionate about music, so I once worked on a project to create a mobile app that generates melodies based on users' emotions. I used audio analysis and machine learning algorithms to recognize the emotional tone of a song and generate a new melody that's similar but not repetitive. I wrote the backend using Flask and used PostgreSQL to store the song data. The user interface was designed using Figma. It was a challenging project, but I loved seeing it come to life and using music to express my creativity. As a tech-enthusiast, I'm thrilled to think about what I can contribute to the world in the next decade. I'd love to apply my skills to developing innovative health technologies that have a tangible impact on people's lives. Imagine a wearable device that can detect biomarkers for chronic diseases and alert patients and healthcare providers in real-time. Or, picture a chatbot that uses AI-powered natural language processing to provide personalized mental health counseling. My ultimate goal is to leverage data science and machine learning to create solutions that transform the healthcare industry and benefit humanity.
