Oh, oh! I'm super excited to share my project with you! During my high school's hackathon, I worked on a voice-based virtual assistant using Go and Figma. I love the way AI integrates with design. My team and I created an intuitive interface that allowed users to control their smart home devices, get news updates, and even book appointments with just their voice! Seeing people interact with our creation and watching it come to life was truly exhilarating. It was an incredible feeling to see the Hey, Siri moment, and I knew right then I was hooked on tech. I'm stoked to be taking on this datathon, and the prospect of tackling a real-world challenge is exhilarating. In the next 10 years, I'm really excited to contribute to developing more accessible and intuitive artificial intelligence-powered communication systems. My ultimate goal is to create a personalized AI-powered voice assistant that can seamlessly bridge language and cultural barriers, enabling people from diverse backgrounds to connect and share ideas on a global scale. The possibilities are endless, and I'm thrilled to be taking the first steps on this innovative journey.
