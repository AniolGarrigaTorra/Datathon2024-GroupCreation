I had an amazing time working on a musical synthesizer app project during my high school summer camp! I used TypeScript and React to create a web-based app that allowed users to generate and manipulate different sounds. I also implemented a basic database to store user-generated presets. It was my first time working with audio processing, and I was hooked. I loved seeing my code come to life in the form of sick beats and melodies. The project not only honed my coding skills but also sparked my creative interest in music production. I'm definitely looking forward to working on more music-related projects! I'm thrilled to think about the impact I can make in the next decade! One thing I'm incredibly excited to work on is developing AI-powered solutions that benefit social causes. I'm passionate about using data to drive positive change, and I envision a future where artificial intelligence is harnessed to amplify voices for marginalized communities, monitor global environmental trends, and bridge the education gap. With my programming skills and entrepreneurial drive, I'd love to collaborate with likeminded individuals to create innovative, technology-led solutions that catalyze meaningful transformations. The thought of it gets me pumped!
