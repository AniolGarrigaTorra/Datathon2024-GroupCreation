I've always been fascinated by AI and NLP, so I worked on a non-technical project where I built a language-learning app for my younger sister's community center. I didn't code it myself, but I designed the concept, user experience, and layout. It was called Chatbot Carmen - a chatbot that taught basic Spanish phrases to kids. I loved seeing kids learn and have fun with it! It was a great way for me to use my creativity and interest in education to make a positive impact. It was also a wonderful experience, as I was able to see the impact of my project on others. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a team that develops a revolutionary blockchain-based healthcare platform. Imagine a secure, transparent, and efficient system that allows patients to control their own medical records, making it easier to share information with healthcare providers while protecting sensitive data. Additionally, it could facilitate the development of personalized medicine, enabling researchers to uncover new treatments and cures. The potential is vast, and I'm excited to be a part of this innovative journey.
