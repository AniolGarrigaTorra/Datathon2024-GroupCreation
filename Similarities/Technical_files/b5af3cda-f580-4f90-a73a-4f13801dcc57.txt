I'm super fond of the IoT-based project I worked on with a friend last semester. We created a low-cost home automation system using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and PostgreSQL! We designed a smartphone app that allowed users to control and monitor their smart home devices, and we even incorporated Computer Vision to recognize and respond to voice commands! It was an incredible learning experience, and seeing our project come to life was a major mood-booster. I loved combining my tech skills with my love for innovation and problem-solving. It was an incredible collaboration and a fantastic way to improve my programming skills while making something genuinely cool! I'm super excited about the prospect of working on projects that combine my passions for Education, Health, and Quantum! In the next 10 years, I'd love to be involved in developing AI-powered adaptive learning systems that utilize quantum computing to optimize educational outcomes for marginalized communities. Imagine having machines learning and adjusting to each student's unique needs in real-time, making education more accessible and inclusive. The thought of being part of this revolution gets me pumped up and inspired!
