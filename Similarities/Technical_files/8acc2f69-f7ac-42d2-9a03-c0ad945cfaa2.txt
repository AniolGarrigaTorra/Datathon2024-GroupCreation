I absolutely loved working on a project that combined my passion for Computer Vision and Blockchain technology. It was a proof-of-concept to develop an intelligent parking system that uses computer vision to detect and recognize cars, and then utilizes blockchain to record and verify transactions. I built the entire project from scratch, from developing the computer vision algorithm to creating the blockchain smart contract. Seeing my idea come to life and being able to test its capabilities was incredibly fulfilling. It was a real-world application that had the potential to make a significant impact, and it was a lot of fun to work on! I'm thrilled about the prospect of making a tangible impact in the realm of personalized healthcare. I envision developing an AI-driven platform that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide patients with tailored disease diagnosis and treatment regimens. The platform would use blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent patient data management. By integrating design thinking, voice skills, and educational content, this revolutionary system would empower individuals to take proactive control of their health, revolutionizing the way we approach healthcare delivery. It's a daunting challenge, but I'm confident that my skills and passion for innovation will help me make it a reality.
