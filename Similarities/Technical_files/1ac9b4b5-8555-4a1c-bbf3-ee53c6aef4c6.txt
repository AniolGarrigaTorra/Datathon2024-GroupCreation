I recently worked on a non-technical project that I absolutely loved - creating a makerspace at my university! I wanted to provide a collaborative space for students to work on their projects, so I organized a team and we renovated an abandoned classroom into a fully-equipped makerspace. It was an incredible experience, from design to execution. We installed workstations, assembled DIY furniture, and set up loaner equipment like 3D printers and laser cutters. Seeing students from all departments and backgrounds come together to work on projects was amazing. It's now one of the most popular spots on campus! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the intersection of Fintech and IoT. My dream is to develop a decentralized, blockchain-based payment system for smart cities, leveraging my programming skills in PostgreSQL, React, and TensorFlow. Imagine a world where sensor-enabled infrastructure monitors energy consumption, traffic patterns, and waste management, and users can seamlessly pay for public services like smart parking, electric vehicle charging, and garbage collection, all on a user-friendly platform. It's ambitious, but I'm pumped to contribute to this futuristic landscape and make a positive impact on people's daily lives.
