I had a blast working on a non-technical project! I designed a logo and brand identity for a local thrift store. It was a fun way to combine my love for design and communication. I got to learn about color theory, typography, and visual storytelling, which is all super fascinating to me. I even got to present my design to the store owners, which was nerve-wracking but also super rewarding! It was an awesome feeling to see my design come to life and know that it's going to help a business connect with their customers. I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of developing immersive AR experiences that transform the way we interact with each other and the world around us. I envision a future where augmented reality technology is seamlessly integrated into daily life, revolutionizing industries like education, healthcare, and entertainment. Imagine being able to walk into a museum and having interactive exhibits come alive around you, or stepping into a virtual try-on room that allows you to see how clothing and accessories look on you without having to physically try them on. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to be a part of shaping this future.
