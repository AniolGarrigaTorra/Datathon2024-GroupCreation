Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share one of my favorite projects with you! Last semester, I worked on a virtual reality game that combined my love for gaming and education. I was part of a team that created an immersive AR experience for students to learn about historical events. We used Unity, React, and TypeScript to build the game, and it was amazing to see how it brought the stories to life! My favorite part was watching my classmates' reactions as they explored the different scenarios. It was an incredible experience that showcased the power of technology to make learning fun and engaging! What a thrilling thought! In the next 10 years, I'd love to dive deeper into the realm of Quantum AI. I'm particularly intrigued by the concept of Quantum-inspired Machine Learning, where we can harness the power of quantum entanglement to develop more accurate and efficient AI models. Imagine it - AI that can simulate complex real-world scenarios, make precise predictions, and tackle challenging problems in areas like health, education, and the environment. The potential to positively impact humanity on a global scale is what gets me pumped! I'd give anything to be part of that pioneering journey.
