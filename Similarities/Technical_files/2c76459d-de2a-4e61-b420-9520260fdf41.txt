I had a blast working on a school project where we built a web scraper using Go to gather data on local environmental initiatives. I loved digging into the code, figuring out how to navigate APIs, and designing a workflow in Figma to display the scraped data. The best part was seeing the impact our project had on a small non-profit that received the data, and feeling like we were making a difference. It was a win-win - I honed my programming skills and contributed to a cause I care about! I'm truly thrilled about the prospect of developing cutting-edge AI-powered disease diagnosis tools! With my background in programming and passion for machine learning, I envision creating sophisticated algorithms that help detect and monitor diseases more accurately and efficiently. Imagine a future where AI-driven medical analysis tools revolutionize healthcare, empowering doctors and researchers to diagnose and treat complex diseases with unprecedented precision. This is my ultimate goal - harnessing the power of AI for good, and I'm ecstatic about the prospect of tackling this challenge at the datathon and potentially transforming the face of medicine forever!
