I loved working on a personal project where I built a digital cataloging system for vintage vinyl records using MongoDB and Flask. I integrated it with a Spotify API to suggest similar artists and albums. It was a great opportunity to apply my machine learning skills and combine my passions for music and tech. Seeing the finished product come together and being able to use it myself was super rewarding. I even got to share it with some fellow record enthusiasts, and they started using it too! It was an awesome way to balance out my schoolwork and creative outlets. I'm thrilled to think about the future and the impact I can make. In the next 10 years, I'm envisioning myself pioneering the development of AI-powered, community-driven, and blockchain-secured e-commerce platforms. Imagine an online marketplace where every individual has a digital twin, with ownership and control over their own data, transactions, and experiences. This could revolutionize the way we shop, collaborate, and live our daily lives. By harnessing the power of machine learning and blockchain, we can create a more transparent, secure, and equitable digital landscape - and I can't wait to be a part of it!
