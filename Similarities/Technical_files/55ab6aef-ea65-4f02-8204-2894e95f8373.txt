I absolutely loved working on a project where I combined my love for design, music, and data analysis! I created a web scraper that analyzed the lyrics of popular songs and generated a visually stunning data visualization dashboard using Figma and JavaScript. It was fascinating to see how different genres and eras affected the themes and emotional intensity of song lyrics. I collaborated with friends on the design, and we had a blast exploring creative ways to represent the data. It was a perfect blend of coding, design, and music - my ultimate trifecta of fun! As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to apply my skills to innovative projects that can make a real impact. In the next 10 years, I'm dreaming big - I want to develop a predictive analytics platform for the music industry. I'd love to work with top record labels and artists to analyze sales data, streaming trends, and social media insights to identify patterns and make informed decisions about talent discovery, playlist curation, and content creation. My goal is to revolutionize the way the music industry approaches its creative process and help uncover the next big stars.
