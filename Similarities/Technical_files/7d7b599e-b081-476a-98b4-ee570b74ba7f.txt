I had a blast working on a project last semester where I designed a smart alarm system using IoT principles and Python. The system would recognize the snores of the user and wake them up during a light sleep phase, ensuring they felt more refreshed. I loved the intersection of tech and psychology that this project allowed for. From setting up the sensors and raspberry pi to implementing a natural language processing algorithm for snores detection, it was an incredible feeling to see my ideas come to life. The outcome was more than just a functional system - it was a solution that improved daily lives! I'm thrilled to share my enthusiasm for a project I've been daydreaming about - creating an innovative urban garden concept using IoT sensors and data analysis. Bloom would be an intelligent, AI-driven greenhouse system that optimizes plant growth, tracking environmental factors, and providing real-time insights for urban farmers, restaurateurs, and food enthusiasts. By integrating IoT sensors, mobile apps, and data visualization tools, Bloom would revolutionize the way we produce, consume, and interact with food. In the next 10 years, I envision Bloom transforming the urban landscape, fostering sustainable communities, and making a positive impact on our planet.
