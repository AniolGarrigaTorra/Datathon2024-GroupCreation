I absolutely loved working on my personal project, a smart trash can notification system using Arduino and React! I created a system that can track waste levels and send alerts to household members when the trash needs to be taken out. I enjoyed the hands-on approach of working with hardware and coding in Java and React. It was an awesome feeling to see my idea come to life. I'm really proud of myself for experimenting and learning from the experience. I even showed it off at a university hackathon and got some great feedback! I'm super excited to dive into quantum computing! As someone who's always fascinated by the intersection of technology and social good, I believe quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries like finance and healthcare. Imagine solving complex problems, like modeling and optimizing large-scale datasets, with unparalleled speed and accuracy. This could have a profound impact on issues like access to healthcare and economic inequality. I'd love to be part of a team working on quantum-based solutions that can have a tangible, positive impact on people's lives. The prospect of contributing to this groundbreaking field gets me stoked!
