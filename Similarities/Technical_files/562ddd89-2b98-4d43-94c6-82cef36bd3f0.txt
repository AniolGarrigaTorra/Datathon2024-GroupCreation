I'm really proud of a little project I worked on last year, building an IoT-based temperature and humidity sensor using a Raspberry Pi and C++. I learned so much about microcontrollers, APIs, and data visualization. It was a super fun project because it combined my interests in IoT and programming. I could see the impact of my code in real-life, monitoring the conditions in my bedroom and adjusting accordingly. It was a great feeling, knowing I'd solved a tangible problem! I displayed it at our school's tech showcase and received some awesome feedback. Can't wait to work on more projects like it! I'm really stoked to dive into more advanced IoT projects that combine machine learning with cybersecurity. In the next 10 years, I envision working on a large-scale smart city infrastructure that utilizes AI-powered threat detection and mitigation to ensure the safety and efficiency of its operations. I'd love to contribute to a project that integrates C++ with machine learning frameworks to develop edge devices that can detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time. It's an exciting prospect to think about the impact this technology could have on people's lives and communities. The future is looking bright!
