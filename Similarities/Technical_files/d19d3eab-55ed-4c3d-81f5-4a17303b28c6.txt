I had a blast working on a project where I used AWS Lambda and Alexa Skills Kit to create a voice assistant for tracking personal habits. I always wanted to try my hand at voice development, and this project allowed me to explore that interest. I designed the UI and UX for the skill, using Figma, and then built the actual skill using Node.js and API Gateway. It was amazing to see it come together and hear my voice assistant say Hey, you've reached your step goal for the day! - it felt like I was having a conversation with a friend. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about advancing voice skills and human-computer interaction in the realm of healthcare. Imagine a world where AI-powered virtual assistants can have nuanced conversations with patients, empathizing with their emotional needs and tailoring health plans to their unique profiles. Within the next 10 years, I envision developing advanced voice capabilities that integrate seamlessly with wearables and medical devices, enabling remote patient monitoring, personalized therapy sessions, and revolutionary communication between patients and healthcare providers.
