One of my favorite projects was creating a chatbot using TypeScript and Node.js. I built it from scratch, designing the conversation flow and programming it to handle basic customer support queries. I was excited to integrate machine learning models to improve its accuracy. Working on this project not only improved my programming skills, but I also enjoyed the creative freedom to customize the chatbot's personality. Seeing it come to life was super rewarding! As I gaze into the future, I'm thrilled to envision myself at the forefront of designing an AI-powered, non-profit financial platform aimed at bridging the financial inclusion gap. The platform, dubbed FinFusion, would leverage machine learning to identify high-potential entrepreneurs in underserved communities and provide them with accessible, affordable credit and investment opportunities. With my passion for Fintech and Social Good, I'm eager to channel my skills to create a lasting impact, empowering individuals to transform their lives and communities. I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals to make this vision a reality!
