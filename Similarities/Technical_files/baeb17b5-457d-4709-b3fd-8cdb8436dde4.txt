One project that really got me pumped up was a social good hackathon I participated in, where we built a AR-powered tool for visually impaired people to navigate their surroundings. We used Computer Vision and React Native to develop an app that used the phone's camera to recognize obstacles and landmarks, providing an audio feedback to the user. I got to work with an amazing team and learned so much about Computer Vision and AR development. Seeing the impact our project had on the community made it an incredibly rewarding experience! I'm thrilled to share that I'm obsessed with the intersection of emerging technologies and their potential to transform societies. In the next 10 years, I envision working on developing artificial intelligence-powered assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities. Specifically, I aim to create an augmented reality platform that empowers the visually impaired to navigate their surroundings independently and efficiently. With my experience in computer vision, machine learning, and React Native, I'm confident that I can play a pivotal role in making this technology a reality and empowering individuals to lead more autonomous lives.
