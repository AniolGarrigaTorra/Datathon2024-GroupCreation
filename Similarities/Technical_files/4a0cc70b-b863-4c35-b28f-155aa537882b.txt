One project I really enjoyed working on was a voice-assisted virtual diary I built using PyTorch and Flask. I've always loved music, and I was inspired to create a digital journal that would let users record their thoughts, mood, and daily highlights and then generate a personalized music playlist based on their entries. It was a blast experimenting with NLP and machine learning to develop the audio processing feature. I also enjoyed the challenge of designing an intuitive UI for users to interact with. Seeing it all come together was super rewarding, and I'd love to expand on it someday! What a thrilling question! I'm Anna, and I'm stoked to think about what's next. In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to work on projects that seamlessly blend voice AI, gaming, and IoT technologies. Imagine an immersive gaming experience where players can control characters using their voices, with the power to affect game environments and other players through wearable devices or home automation systems. I envision this convergence becoming increasingly common, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. My goal is to contribute to shaping this future, pushing boundaries, and making innovation more accessible to everyone.
