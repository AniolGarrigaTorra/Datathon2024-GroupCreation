I had a blast working on a non-technical project, a passion project to reduce food waste in my community! I organized a team of friends and together, we built an online platform to connect local businesses with community volunteers to pick up surplus food before it goes to waste. I handled the website development using React, while my friends worked on marketing and outreach. It was an incredible experience, combining my interests in design and social impact. Watching our effort bear fruit and seeing the tangible impact we've had in reducing food waste has been incredibly fulfilling! I'm thrilled to share that I've been passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare, and I'm excited to work on developing AI-powered wearable devices that can help individuals with chronic illnesses better manage their condition. I envision a future where these devices can integrate seamlessly with a patient's medical records and provide personalized recommendations for treatment and lifestyle adjustments. With the rise of IoT and machine learning, I believe we're on the cusp of a revolution in personalized medicine. I'd love to contribute to making that vision a reality and improve the lives of millions worldwide.
