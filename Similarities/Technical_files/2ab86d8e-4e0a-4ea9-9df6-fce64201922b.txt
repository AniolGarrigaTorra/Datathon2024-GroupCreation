I worked on a project where I built a simple chatbot using React Native, aiming to help my family members stay organized and on top of tasks at home. I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user inputs and responded accordingly. I learned a ton about UI/UX design and implemented a simple UI that was easy to use. Seeing my family actually use the app and finding it helpful was incredibly fulfilling. It was a great feeling to be able to make a tangible difference in their lives, and it got me pumped to work on more practical projects like this one! I'm thrilled to share that I'm fixated on the idea of developing a smart home automation system utilizing AI and machine learning. Imagine a futuristic abode where lights, thermostats, and appliances adapt to your preferences and habits seamlessly. I envision building a sleek and intuitive interface for users to control their smart homes with mere voice commands. I believe that by leveraging advancements in computer vision, natural language processing, and cybersecurity, I can make this concept a reality. The prospect of revolutionizing the way we interact with our living spaces is what gets me pumped for the future!
