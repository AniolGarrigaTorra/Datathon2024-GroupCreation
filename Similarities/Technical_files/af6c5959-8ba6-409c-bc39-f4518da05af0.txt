I loved working on a personal project where I built a simple health tracker app using TypeScript and Android Development! I was trying to manage my own workout routine and wanted a more personalized experience, so I created an app that lets me log my exercises, set reminders, and track my progress. It was super fun building it from scratch and getting to see my ideas come to life. Even better, I started sharing it with friends and they loved it too! It was a great way for me to practice what I've learned in class and experiment with new features and functionality. I'm excited to work on developing innovative solutions that can bridge the healthcare gap in underserved communities. As someone passionate about education and healthcare, I believe that technology can play a crucial role in improving access to quality care. I'd love to develop AI-powered health diagnostic tools, wearables, or even telemedicine platforms that can reach remote areas and provide lifesaving interventions. The idea of empowering healthcare professionals with data-driven insights and empowering patients with personalized care excites me. My ultimate dream is to co-found a healthtech startup that can make a meaningful impact in the world.
