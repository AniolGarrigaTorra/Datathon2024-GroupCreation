I recently built a mobile app using Swift and TensorFlow to detect and classify different emotions from facial expressions. It was my first major project on computer vision, and I found it super challenging but super rewarding. I experimented with PyTorch and OpenCV to preprocess the images and trained a neural network to recognize emotions. I even integrated Apple's Core ML framework to run the model on the device. Seeing the app recognize emotions and responding accordingly was awesome! I'm proud of how far I came, and it's projects like these that get me hyped to work on more cutting-edge tech. I'm thrilled to envision a future where blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we approach global healthcare. I'd love to develop an augmented reality-based health monitoring system, enabling people to track their vital signs and health metrics in real-time. This technology could empower patients to make informed decisions, facilitate remote consultations, and streamline healthcare workflows. With the help of computer vision and machine learning tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, I believe we can create a more accessible, efficient, and effective healthcare ecosystem. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm excited to start working on it and contributing to its potential.
