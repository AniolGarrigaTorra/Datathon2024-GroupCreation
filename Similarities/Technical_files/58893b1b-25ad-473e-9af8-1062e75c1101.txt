I had a blast working on a mobile app project for a social cause - creating a messaging platform for underprivileged communities to connect with local resources and organizations. I used React Native to build the app, which allowed me to focus on the UI and UX. I designed the app to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that made it easy for users to access vital services. Seeing the app come to life and knowing it could have a real impact was incredibly rewarding. It's projects like these that remind me why I love programming - the chance to make a difference! As a aspiring data enthusiast, I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing AI-powered solutions that promote social impact. In the next 10 years, I hope to work on building a sustainable, AI-driven platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to connect NGOs and activists with local communities worldwide, facilitating access to vital resources and amplifying marginalized voices. My goal is to empower grassroots movements and spark meaningful social change through data-driven storytelling and visualizations, all while continuously refining my skills and learning from mentors and peers in this exciting field.
