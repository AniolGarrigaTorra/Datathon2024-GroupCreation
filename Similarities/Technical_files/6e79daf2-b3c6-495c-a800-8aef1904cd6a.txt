I had a blast working on a personal project that merged my love for design and programming. I created a customizable AR-powered lamp shade using Flutter and computer vision! It allows users to design their own lamp shade design and see it come to life in augmented reality. I experimented with various shape recognition algorithms and implemented a intuitive user interface. Seeing the lamp come to life and adjusting the design in real-time was so satisfying. It was a challenging project, but the outcome was totally worth it. I even pitched it to a few startups and they showed some interest! I'm thrilled to think about the exciting possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. In the next decade, I envision a world where augmented reality has become an integral part of our daily lives, revolutionizing the way we interact, learn, and collaborate. Imagine having AI-powered, IoT-enabled smart homes, offices, and cities that adapt to our needs and preferences, making life more convenient, efficient, and sustainable. It's an opportunity to use my skills to create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between humanity and technology, and I can't wait to be a part of it!
