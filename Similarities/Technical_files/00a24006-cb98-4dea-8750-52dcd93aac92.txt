I had a blast working on a project called Melodia where I created a music generation AI bot using Python and Machine Learning. I gathered a dataset of various music genres and trained the bot to generate original melodies. It was amazing to see the AI's ability to improvise and create unique compositions! I even experimented with applying it to gaming environments, creating interactive soundtracks. The thrill of seeing users enjoy the bot's music and the challenge of perfecting its algorithms drove me to keep improving it. It was an incredible feeling, merging art and tech! In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to dive into the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in the field of augmented reality. I envision a future where interactive art pieces can transform urban spaces, immersing citizens in unique and captivating experiences. Imagine walking down the street and stumbling upon a digital installation that reacts to your footsteps or voice, generating an ever-changing soundscape or visual feast. As someone who combines art and technology, I'd love to pioneer innovative AR applications that blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds, redefining public spaces for the better.
