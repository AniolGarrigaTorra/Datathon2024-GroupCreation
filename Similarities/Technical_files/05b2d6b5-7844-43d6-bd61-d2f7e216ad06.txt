One of my favorite projects was a personal mobile app I built to track my fitness goals. I'm a bit of a gym enthusiast, and I wanted a more user-friendly way to keep tabs on my workouts and nutrition plan. Using my skills in iOS development and SQL, I designed a custom app that lets me log exercises, track progress, and set reminders. It's been a game-changer for staying motivated and seeing results! I love how it's a real-world application of my programming knowledge that has a direct impact on my daily life. I'm thrilled to think about the impact I'd like to make in the next decade! As someone who's passionate about Fintech and Social Good, I'd love to work on a project that utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and inclusive financial system for underprivileged communities. Imagine a digital platform that empowers people with limited access to financial services to save, invest, and pay bills securely, with data stored on a blockchain network for maximum safety. It's a lofty goal, I know, but I'm excited to learn from fellow datathoners and mentors who can help me take my skills to the next level and make this dream a reality.
