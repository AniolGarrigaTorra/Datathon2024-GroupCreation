I've always been fascinated by the potential of augmented reality! For my final project in university, I created a VR experience that allows users to create and customize their own AR art gallery. I used Python and React Native to build the interface, and machine learning to optimize the object detection and recognition algorithms. It was an incredible challenge that pushed me to learn so much, and the end result was a blast! Seeing people's faces light up as they stepped into the digital gallery was the most rewarding part. I can't wait to build more immersive experiences like this! I'm thrilled to share my aspirations for the next decade! As an enthusiast of AR/VR, I'm eager to contribute to the development of immersive technologies that transcend the boundaries of physical spaces. I envision working on a project that fuses augmented reality with machine learning to create personalized, interactive art exhibits that evoke a sense of wonder and awe in the viewer. My goal is to pioneer innovative storytelling methods that merge the virtual and physical realms, allowing people to engage with art, history, and culture in entirely new and captivating ways. The possibilities are endless, and I'm ready to dive in!
