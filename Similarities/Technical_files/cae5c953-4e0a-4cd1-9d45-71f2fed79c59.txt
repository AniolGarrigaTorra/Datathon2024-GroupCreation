I had a blast working on a music festival scheduling project during my sophomore year. It was a non-technical project that combined my love for music, art, and design. I was tasked with creating a visualization showcasing the schedule and lineup of a hypothetical festival. I used Adobe Illustrator to design the layout and integrated a dataset to create a interactive map of the festival grounds. It was an excellent exercise in spatial reasoning and creativity. Seeing my design come to life was incredibly fulfilling, and I received great feedback from my peers. It's projects like these that make me excited for more! As I look ahead to the next decade, I'm thrilled to envision a future where I can leverage my passion for programming and problem-solving to make a significant impact. My dream is to co-found a socially responsible startup that develops cutting-edge, AI-powered tools to improve mental health and wellness, particularly among young people. This could involve creating smart, wearable devices that monitor and respond to physiological and emotional signals, or developing AI-powered chatbots that offer personalized coping strategies and support.
