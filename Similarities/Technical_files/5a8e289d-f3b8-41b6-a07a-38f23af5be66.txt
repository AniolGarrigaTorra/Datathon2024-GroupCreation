One project that really stands out to me is a robotic process automation tool I worked on over the summer. It was a solo project, and I designed and built a UI for automating tasks in a chatbot. I used TensorFlow to train the chatbot's sentiment analysis model and Docker to containerize the whole setup. It was super challenging, but the satisfaction of seeing it all come together was incredible. What I enjoyed most was the ability to create something tangible and useful, and knowing that it could be applied to real-world scenarios. It was an amazing experience! I'm thrilled about the prospect of working on Human-Machine Interface (HMI) technologies that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Imagine designing intelligent systems that allow people with disabilities to seamlessly interact with virtual assistants, access information, and control their environment with ease. This futuristic scenario fascinates me, and I believe that by leveraging my skills in UI/UX Design, Artificial Intelligence, and robotics, I can contribute to creating a more inclusive and intuitive world. In the next 10 years, I envision pushing the boundaries of assistive technology to empower people and make a meaningful impact on their daily lives.
