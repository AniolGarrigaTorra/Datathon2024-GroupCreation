One of my favorite projects I've worked on was a personal project where I built a simple chatbot using Blockchain to keep records of conversations! It was a really cool experience combining my interests in programming and machine learning. I used Go to develop the bot, and TypeScript to create a user-friendly interface. I even dabbled in some data visualization using a library called D3.js to display some really cool metrics about user engagement. Overall, it was a blast to work on something that was both fun and educational - I felt like I was actually using my skills to make a real difference! As a student, I'm excited to see the impact I can make in the field of healthcare technology! In the next 10 years, I hope to work on developing AI-powered platforms that help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat diseases more accurately and efficiently. Specifically, I'm passionate about creating a blockchain-based electronic health record system that safeguards patient data and enables seamless sharing among medical professionals. This, combined with machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, can revolutionize patient care and quality of life. The idea of making a tangible difference in people's lives excites me and motivates me to keep pushing forward!
