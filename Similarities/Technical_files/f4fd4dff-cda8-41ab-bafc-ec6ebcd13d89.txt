I'm really passionate about music, so I loved working on a project that combined music with tech. I built a simple music visualizer using Python and the Raspberry Pi. I used the device's camera to detect the edges of a music waveform and then used Python to animate the visuals in real-time. It was amazing to see the music come to life on the screen! Not only did I learn about computer vision and Raspberry Pi, but I also got to experiment with creative coding. It was a fantastic way to combine my technical skills with my love for music and art. I'm really enthusiastic about developing AI-powered healthcare solutions that can help patients with chronic illnesses, like diabetes, manage their condition more effectively. I envision an intelligent system that uses IoT sensors, AR/VR, and predictive analytics to monitor patients' vital signs and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Additionally, the system could alert healthcare providers if there's a discrepancy in the patient's data, allowing for timely interventions. I'd love to be part of a team that brings this innovative solution to life, making a real impact on people's lives.
