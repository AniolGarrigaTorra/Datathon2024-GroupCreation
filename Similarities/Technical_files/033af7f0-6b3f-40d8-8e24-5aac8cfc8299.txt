I'm really passionate about robotic process automation! Last semester, I worked on a project to build a chatbot using TypeScript and Blockchain technology. The goal was to automate tasks for small businesses, streamlining their processes and reducing manual labor. It was a blast! I enjoyed designing the chatbot's user interface, implementing Natural Language Processing, and integrating it with the Blockchain to ensure secure data storage. Seeing it come to life and watching my friends' reactions when I demoed it was incredibly fulfilling. It's a great example of how tech can make a real impact on people's lives. As someone passionate about Social Good, I'm thrilled about the potential impact of technology on global healthcare. In the next decade, I'm excited to contribute to the development of AI-powered telemedicine platforms that connect underserved communities with qualified healthcare professionals. I envision a future where blockchain-enabled patient data management ensures secure, accessible, and efficient care delivery. By leveraging Machine Learning algorithms and NLP, these platforms can provide real-time triage, diagnosis, and remote monitoring, ultimately saving lives and improving healthcare outcomes. The prospect of making a tangible difference in people's lives drives my motivation for this work.
