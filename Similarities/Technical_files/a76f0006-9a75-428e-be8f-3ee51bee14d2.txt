I recently worked on a personal project that I'm super proud of - a chatbot using PyTorch and Flask that helps people cope with stress and anxiety! I've always been passionate about mental health awareness, and I wanted to create something that could have a real impact on people's lives. It was a challenging project, but I loved the thrill of designing a conversational flow, training a machine learning model, and integrating it with a web interface. Seeing it come to life and helping someone feel supported was an incredible feeling - it's why I'm so hyped to be here at the datathon, ready to take on new challenges! I'm thrilled to share my ambitions! In the next 10 years, I'm looking forward to working on a project that combines my passions for machine learning, healthcare, and blockchain. Imagine a decentralized, AI-powered platform that enables people to securely store, manage, and monetize their own health data. By creating a community-driven marketplace, we can empower patients to take control of their wellness journey, and reward healthcare providers and researchers for developing innovative treatments. It's a lofty goal, but I believe it's essential for improving global health outcomes and redefining the patient-provider relationship. Bring on the challenge!
