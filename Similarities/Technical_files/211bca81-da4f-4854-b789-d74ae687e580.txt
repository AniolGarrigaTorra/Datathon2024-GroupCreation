One project that still sparks joy for me is a blockchain-based food waste tracking system I worked on during my summer internship. As an intern at a social enterprise, I was tasked with creating a proof-of-concept for a platform that connects food producers, consumers, and meal prep services to reduce food waste. It was amazing to see how blockchain technology can be applied to social good. I loved researching different consensus algorithms, implementing them in Rust, and then using computer vision to track food storage conditions. Seeing the potential impact was incredibly motivating! I'm thrilled about the prospect of contributing to the development of a decentralized, blockchain-based network that focuses on social and environmental impact. My ultimate goal is to design and implement an IoT-enabled, accessible, and community-driven platform that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to monitor and mitigate the effects of climate change. Imagine a world where individuals can monitor air quality, monitor deforestation, and even track wildlife conservation efforts in real-time, all from their smart home devices or AR glasses! The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to see how I can help shape the future of sustainability.
