I recently created a simple mobile app using Flutter for my school's event management system. I enjoyed the hands-on experience with UI/UX design and development. I designed a user-friendly interface and implemented features to manage events, RSVPs, and reminders. I'm proud of how it turned out! It was my first project that combined my interests in programming and social good. I loved the feeling of seeing my design come to life and knowing that it would make a difference in my school community. It was a great way to apply my skills and make a tangible impact. I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about creating a sustainable, environmentally-friendly housing solution for developing communities. I envision a futuristic city, equipped with green architecture, intelligent water management systems, and waste-to-energy facilities. As a student, I've already dabbled in C++ and Flutter, and I believe that combining these skills with machine learning and AR/VR technologies can revolutionize the way we live. I'm excited to continue learning and working on this ambitious project, bringing positive impact to global communities and making a dent in the fight against climate change.
