One project that comes to mind is building a custom iOS game during my university's annual hackathon. I worked on it with a few friends, and we created a game inspired by classic RPGs. We designed the game mechanics, implemented them using React Native, and added some cool visual effects using Figma. Seeing the game come to life and watching players enjoying it was incredibly satisfying. I loved the creative freedom and collaborative process of working on this project. It was a great way to combine my passions for gaming and coding, and I took away many valuable lessons that I'm still applying today! In the next 10 years, I'm extremely excited to be working on revolutionizing the gaming industry with Artificial Intelligence. I envision creating a cutting-edge AI-powered game engine that can generate procedurally generated content, allowing players to experience a completely unique gaming journey each time. This technology can also be applied to other areas such as edutainment, mental health, and even accessibility. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential for machine learning to simulate human-like dialogue and storytelling, immersing players in a more authentic experience. This is the kind of ambitious project that truly gets me pumped!
