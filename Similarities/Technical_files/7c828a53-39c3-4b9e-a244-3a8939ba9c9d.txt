I really enjoyed working on a Figma design project for a fictional e-commerce website I'd created. It was awesome to think about the user experience, creating wireframes, and refining the layout to ensure a smooth customer journey. I experimented with different typography and color schemes, which taught me a lot about visual design and the emotional impact of layout. Seeing the design come to life in Figma was incredibly satisfying! The non-technical skills I used, like creative problem-solving and attention to detail, are surprisingly relevant in software development too, which has encouraged me to pursue more design-related projects. As a student with a passion for E-commerce and Fintech, I'm thrilled to think about the possibility of contributing to the development of seamless and innovative payment systems for online retailers. Imagine a world where checkout processes are automated, and customers can make secure transactions with just a tap of their mobile device. In the next 10 years, I envision building a sustainable and efficient payment gateway that integrates IoT technology, allowing for greater transparency and reduced costs. The thrill of working on such a project excites me, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way we shop and interact online.
