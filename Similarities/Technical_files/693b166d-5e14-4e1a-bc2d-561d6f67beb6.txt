I loved working on a project I did during my junior year - a smart fridge organization system using TypeScript and Rust. I was tasked with designing an intelligent way to categorize and display kitchen items. It was a fun project because I got to combine my love of programming with my obsession with lifehacks! I enjoyed the creative freedom to come up with innovative solutions, like implementing a AI-powered object recognition system to scan and identify items. It was a great learning experience, and I was proud to see my project come to life. Who knew fridge management could be so exciting? As someone who's passionate about innovation, I'm excited to work on revolutionizing the way we approach human-computer interaction. In the next 10 years, I'd love to be part of a team that develops AI-powered augmented reality (AR) platforms that seamlessly integrate with our daily lives. Imagine being able to walk into a room and having personalized information, services, and guidance literally at your fingertips. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to leverage my skills in PyTorch and PostgreSQL to contribute to this vision. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even win a datathon with an AR solution!
