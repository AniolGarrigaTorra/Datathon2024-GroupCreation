I loved working on a Lifehack project where I built a simple chatbot using React Native to help college students stay organized and focused. I was thrilled to use my programming skills to make a tangible impact on someone's daily life. I spent hours brainstorming ideas, designing the user interface, and integrating various functionalities. Seeing it come to life was an incredible feeling! The feedback from students was awesome, and it motivated me to continue exploring AI and design principles. I'm thrilled to envision a future where technology seamlessly integrates with daily life to alleviate societal burdens. Over the next decade, I hope to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that empower people with disabilities. As a student, I've witnessed the life-changing impact of assistive technology, and I'm passionate about building AI-powered solutions that enhance mobility, communication, and accessibility. Through my datathon experiences, I aim to refine my skills in machine learning, NLP, and IoT, and apply them to co-create innovative assistive technologies that transform the lives of individuals worldwide.
