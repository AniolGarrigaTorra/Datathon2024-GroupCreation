Oh my gosh, I had the best time working on a personal project I called StyleSphere! It's an e-commerce platform that uses AI to recommend outfits based on users' fashion preferences. I dove into TensorFlow to build the recommendation engine and created the UI/UX design using HTML/CSS. It was a blast learning how to manipulate images and combine my love for retail and tech. Even though it's still a work in progress, I'm so proud of what I've accomplished and can't wait to show it off at the datathon (maybe even win a prize or two!). I'm thrilled to share my ambitious goal! In the next decade, I'm excited to pioneer a decentralized social-commerce platform that utilizes blockchain technology to empower small, ethical businesses worldwide. Imagine a platform where consumers can buy direct from artisans, farmers, and makers, while also accessing education on sustainable practices and receiving exclusive experiences. By leveraging PostgreSQL for storage, TensorFlow for predictive analytics, and my UI/UX design skills, I envision a seamless, gamified experience that benefits both individuals and the environment. It's a bold vision, but I believe in making a meaningful impact and having a lasting legacy.
