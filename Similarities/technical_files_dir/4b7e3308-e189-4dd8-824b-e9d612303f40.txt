One project that stands out to me was a mobile app I worked on for a friend's startup, which aimed to help people keep track of their water intake. I learned a lot about designing an app's user interface and creating a seamless user experience. Using Figma, I brought my friend's initial idea to life, creating wireframes and high-fidelity designs for the app's layout and navigation. Implementing the app's functionality using Flutter and Firebase, I overcame the challenge of designing a simple yet effective system for tracking water consumption. It was an awesome project that really made me go aha! I'm thrilled to share that I'm deeply passionate about Quantum Artificial Intelligence, and I envision working on developing intelligent systems that can integrate quantum computing with machine learning to enable breakthroughs in fields like medicine and climate modeling. In the next 10 years, I hope to be part of a team that pioneers the development of these quantum-empowered AI systems, capable of solving previously unsolvable problems. With the exponential growth of both AI and quantum computing, I firmly believe that the possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to contribute to shaping the future of this cutting-edge field.
