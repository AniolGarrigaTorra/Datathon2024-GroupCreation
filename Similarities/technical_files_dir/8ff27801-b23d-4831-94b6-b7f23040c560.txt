I had an absolute blast working on a mobile app project that combined computer vision and UI/UX design! I developed an augmented reality (AR) painting app that allowed users to paint digital masterpieces on real-world surfaces. I created a custom ARKit-powered framework that tracked the user's camera and overlaid digital brushes on the real-world environment. It was such a thrill to see users experiencing the magic of AR painting. This project not only honed my technical skills but also sparked my creativity and passion for innovation! I'm really excited about the prospect of working on projects that combine my passions for art, technology, and education! In the next 10 years, I hope to be a part of developing innovative AI-powered creative tools that enable students to express themselves more effectively. Imagine a world where art therapy is made more accessible, and AI-assisted instruments empower individuals with disabilities to create stunning masterpieces. I envision a future where I'm designing intuitive, VR-based educational platforms that make learning an immersive, gamified experience. That's the kind of impact I want to make - something that truly makes a difference!
