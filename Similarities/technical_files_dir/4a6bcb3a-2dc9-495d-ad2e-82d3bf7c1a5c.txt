I'm so glad you asked! One of my favorite non-technical projects I've worked on is a community-driven blockchain-based game. I was part of the design team, responsible for crafting an engaging UI/UX experience for players. I created wireframes, prototypes, and designed intuitive layouts to make the game enjoyable for users of all skill levels. Seeing my designs come to life, watching players interact with the game, and receiving feedback from the community was incredibly rewarding. It was a great experience that combined my passions for design, blockchain, and gaming. I learned a lot and developed my design skills beyond my tech-oriented comfort zone! I'm thrilled to share that I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize various aspects of our daily lives. In the next 10 years, I envision myself working on developing a decentralized platform that utilizes blockchain to create a secure and transparent supply chain management system for small businesses and organizations. Imagine being able to track the origin and history of any product, ensuring authenticity and quality, while also providing fair trade practices and benefits to local communities. It's a daunting but exhilarating challenge that will require me to push my skills to the limit.
