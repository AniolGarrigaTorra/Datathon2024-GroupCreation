One project that really stood out to me was when I built a blockchain-based voting system using TensorFlow for facial recognition and React for the frontend. I really enjoyed learning about how blockchain technology can be applied to solve real-world problems like election tampering and ensuring transparency. It was a huge challenge to grasp the complex concepts, but working on this project allowed me to explore my interest in Fintech and Social Good. I loved seeing how a concept from school translated to a real-world application. I'm absolutely pumped to work on something that can have a tangible impact on people's lives. Over the next 10 years, I'm excited to explore the development of a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that utilizes AI-powered computer vision to facilitate real-time disaster relief efforts. Imagine being able to quickly and efficiently identify victims trapped under rubble, track vital supplies, and even predict evacuation routes using cutting-edge tech. It's daunting, yes, but the thought of empowering disaster response teams to act more efficiently and effectively is incredibly motivating to me. It's a lofty goal, but I'm excited to take the first steps.
