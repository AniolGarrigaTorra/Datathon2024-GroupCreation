I loved working on a personal project where I built a mobile app using Flutter to help students keep track of their assignments and deadlines. It was a fun challenge to design and develop a UI/UX that was both functional and visually appealing. The non-technical part that I enjoyed was gathering feedback from friends and classmates, which helped me improve the app and make it more user-friendly. Seeing the app come to life and knowing that it could potentially make a difference in someone's study routine was incredibly rewarding. I'm thrilled to think about what's on the horizon! In the next 10 years, I'm particularly excited to work on developing innovative education platforms that utilize blockchain technology to empower students. Imagine a platform where students can create and trade their own, decentralized, virtual portfolios, showcasing their projects and achievements, while maintaining complete ownership and control. This would not only help build a more transparent and decentralized network for students but also encourage creativity, collaboration, and skill-building in an inclusive and accessible way.
