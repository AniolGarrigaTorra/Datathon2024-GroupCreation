I recently built a habit tracking app using React Native and Flask, which allowed me to organize my daily tasks and track my productivity. What I enjoyed most about this project was the process of designing a user-friendly interface and implementing features that made it easy for users to stay consistent. As someone who's always looking to improve their habits, it was rewarding to see my own workflow improve as I tested the app. I also enjoyed learning about APIs and integrating them into the project. Overall, it was a great experience that helped me grow as a developer. I'm thrilled to think about the future projects that will unfold. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on developing an AI-powered virtual assistant that simplifies and streamlines financial management for individuals. I envision an app that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized budgeting advice, automatic expense tracking, and investment recommendations. My goal is to empower people to take control of their finances, achieve financial literacy, and live more secure and fulfilling lives. The idea of creating something that truly makes a difference in people's daily lives is what gets me pumped!
