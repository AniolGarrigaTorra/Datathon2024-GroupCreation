One project that really stands out to me is a blockchain-based supply chain management system I built during my first year of university. It was a group project, and we worked together to create a platform that allows retailers to track their products from manufacturing to customer delivery. I was responsible for building the frontend using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, while my teammates handled the backend development. I loved seeing how our project could potentially make a real difference in the way products are transported and managed. It was an amazing feeling to see our project come together and function seamlessly! I'm thrilled to share that I'm eagerly awaiting the opportunity to develop an e-commerce platform that leverages blockchain technology to empower marginalized communities worldwide. Envisioning a platform that facilitates access to affordable, high-quality education and employment opportunities, I believe blockchain can bring transparency and trust to global supply chains, benefitting not only consumers but also small-scale producers. In the next decade, I'd love to collaborate with social entrepreneurs, governments, and industries to drive this vision forward. The prospect of harnessing tech to create positive global impact drives me and fills me with limitless excitement!
