I loved working on a school project where we created a simple mobile game using Flutter. It was my first time diving into game development, and I was hooked! Our game, Galactic Odyssey, was a space-themed endless runner where players collect power-ups and upgrade their spaceships. I enjoyed the entire process, from designing the UI/UX to coding the game logic. Seeing our game come together and playing through the different levels was an amazing feeling. It was a great team project, and we even released it on the app store. That sense of accomplishment was incredible! As I reflect on my goals, I'm really passionate about empowering Education and Accessibility through tech. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing an innovative, accessible, and inclusive platform that leverages voice-to-text technology and artificial intelligence to help children with disabilities learn and communicate more effectively. Imagine a world where students with special needs can learn and express themselves freely, breaking down barriers and increasing opportunities. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm eager to collaborate with fellow innovators and make it a reality. Bring on the challenge!
