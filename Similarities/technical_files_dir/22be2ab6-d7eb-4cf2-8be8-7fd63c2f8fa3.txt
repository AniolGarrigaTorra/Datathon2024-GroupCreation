I absolutely loved working on a React Native project where I created a mobile app that helps users track and manage their daily finances. I enjoyed the process of designing the user interface using Figma and then bringing it to life using React Native. The project required me to dig deep into JavaScript and learn new concepts, which was really rewarding. Seeing the app come together and watching users try it out was incredibly fulfilling. It was a great exercise in Agile methodology, working with a sprint cycle and iterating based on feedback. I'm really stoked to tackle some futuristic problems. One thing I'm super excited about is working on developing sustainable, eco-friendly solutions for energy harvesting and consumption using AI and Quantum computing. Imagine a world where cities are powered by AI-driven, self-sustaining energy grids that learn and adapt to consumption patterns, minimizing waste and carbon footprint. The thought of using my skills to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future is incredibly thrilling. It's a daunting task, but I believe the payoff would be massive and have a profound impact on the planet.
