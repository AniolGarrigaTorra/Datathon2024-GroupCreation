I recently worked on a project to build a mobile app for managing a personal library using React Native. It was my first solo project, and I was really excited to see my idea come to life! I loved designing the UI, implementing a simple authentication system, and connecting to a SQL database to store the book data. Seeing the app on my phone was a huge accomplishment for me. Although it's not perfect, it taught me so much about developing for mobile devices and gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment. I'm eager to build upon it and add more features! I'm thrilled to think about my dreams for the next 10 years! As someone fascinated by Voice skills and AI, I'd love to dive deeper into developing conversational AI models that can seamlessly interact with humans. My ultimate goal is to work on an AI-powered avatar that can assist people with disabilities, helping them navigate complex environments and scenarios with greater ease. I'd be responsible for designing and implementing a scalable architecture that enables the avatar to learn and adapt to users' needs. It's a lofty ambition, but I'm excited to explore the possibilities and push the boundaries of innovation!
