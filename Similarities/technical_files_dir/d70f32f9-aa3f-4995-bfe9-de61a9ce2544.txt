I'm super excited to share a non-technical project I worked on - a mental health journaling app called MindScape! As a student and enthusiast of health-related topics, I noticed a need for a more organized and user-friendly way to track emotions and thoughts. I designed the app with a clean interface, allowing users to record their daily thoughts, mood, and habits. The app also includes a community feature to connect with others and access mindfulness resources. It was amazing to see the impact it had on friends and family who tried it out - it felt like I was making a difference! I'm thrilled about the prospect of tackling a revolutionary project that combines my passions for health and robotics. In the next 10 years, I envision developing an AI-powered telemedicine platform that utilizes blockchain technology to securely store and manage patient data. The platform would utilize machine learning algorithms to provide personalized health recommendations, monitor chronic conditions, and streamline medical research. I'm eager to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams and make a meaningful impact on healthcare. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm excited to bring my skills to the table and see this vision become a reality.
