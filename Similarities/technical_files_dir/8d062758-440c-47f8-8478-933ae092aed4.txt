I really enjoyed working on a personal project where I built a habit tracker app using Flutter and Firebase. I wanted to create an app that would help me stay organized and motivated with my daily tasks and habits. It was a great experience because I got to apply my programming skills to something that genuinely interested me, and I learned a lot about UI/UX design and Firebase functionality. Plus, I could use it to track my own progress, which was super helpful! I'm thrilled to share my ambition with you! I'm passionate about the convergence of healthcare and technology, so in the next decade, I'd love to work on a project that combines medical research, machine learning, and game development. Imagine a mobile application that uses AI-powered personalized game interfaces to treat mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. The app would utilize data from wearable devices, user interactions, and medical records to adapt and evolve treatment plans. I envision collaborating with clinicians, data scientists, and gamers to create a game-changing solution that improves mental health outcomes worldwide.
