I had an absolute blast working on my last hackathon project, Melodia, a music recognition app! I used TypeScript to create a React Native app that identifies song melodies and syncs users' playlists with artists and albums. I loved the creative problem-solving aspect of mapping audio signals to musical notes, and designing a user-friendly interface to make music discovery easy and fun. My passion for music combined with coding expertise made this project a true standout for me. It was an incredible feeling seeing my app come to life and receiving great feedback from users - it solidified my love for DevOps! I'm thrilled to think about the impact I'd like to make with my passion for programming. In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to work on a project that uses AI and machine learning to create an accessible music therapy platform. This platform would analyze users' brain activity and music preferences to provide personalized playlists for individuals with autism, dementia, and other neurological disorders. I'd love to collaborate with experts in music therapy, neuroscience, and AI development to make a real difference in people's lives. It's a challenging but achievable goal, and I'm excited to see where my skills and passion can take me.
