One project that really stands out to me is the IoT home automation system I built with my friends. We used Java to program a microcontroller and connected it to sensors and actuators. I was responsible for the communication protocol between the microcontroller and a web interface made with Figma. It was so cool to see everything come together and work seamlessly! We could control the lighting and temperature in our room remotely using the web interface or even using voice commands through a speaker we connected. It was a great experience, and I'm proud of what we accomplished. I'm thrilled to see the potential for innovation in the field of DevOps and IoT. In the next 10 years, I envision myself contributing to the development of a smart, self-sustaining city that integrates AI, sensors, and automation to enhance the quality of life for its residents. Imagine a city that optimizes energy consumption, traffic flow, and waste management, while also providing accessible healthcare and education services. As a budding programmer, I'd love to play a role in designing and implementing the software infrastructure that makes this vision a reality. It's a challenge that excites and motivates me!
