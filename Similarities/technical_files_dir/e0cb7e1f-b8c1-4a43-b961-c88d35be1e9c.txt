Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share this with you! Last semester, I worked on a project that combined two of my passions: Social Good and Machine Learning. I developed a dashboard to track and visualize mental health statistics using a machine learning model trained on publicly available datasets. I loved that it tackled a critical issue and allowed me to put my coding skills to use for the greater good. I also enjoyed creating interactive visualizations with D3.js to make the data more accessible and understandable. It was an incredible feeling to see the impact it could have, and I'm super proud of what I achieved! I'm stoked about the prospect of developing machine learning models that enable personalized, precision-medicine strategies to combat complex diseases like cancer. With advancements in data analytics and AI, I envision creating disease-prediction platforms that empower clinicians to tailor treatments to individual patients' needs. This, in turn, could lead to significantly improved treatment outcomes and quality of life for those affected. As someone passionate about Social Good, I find it thrilling to think about how data science can drive meaningful, patient-centered innovation that makes a tangible impact on healthcare. That's the kind of challenge I thrive on!
