I loved working on a personal project where I built a machine learning-powered chatbot to help seniors with dementia communicate more effectively. I used natural language processing techniques to develop the bot's language understanding and generated a user-friendly interface using UI/UX design principles. The project combined my interests in Social Good and Machine Learning, and it was rewarding to see the positive impact it could have on people's lives. It was a challenging but fun project that pushed me to learn new skills and think creatively. I hope to build upon this project and make it more robust during the datathon! I'm thrilled to see where my passions for Cybersecurity, Social Good, and Machine Learning will take me. In the next 10 years, I envision creating a comprehensive platform that utilizes blockchain, AI, and data analysis to amplify marginalized voices and bring about positive change in the world. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data visualization, I hope to help organizations, governments, and communities better track and address pressing issues like human trafficking, climate change, and economic inequality. The prospect of making a tangible impact on the world while also pushing the boundaries of innovation is what truly excites me about the future.
