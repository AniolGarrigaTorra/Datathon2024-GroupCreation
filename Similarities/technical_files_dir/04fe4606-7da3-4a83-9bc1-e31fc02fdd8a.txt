I had an absolute blast working on a IoT project called Smart Garden in one of my earlier hackathons. It was an idea to create a smart watering system that uses machine learning to monitor soil moisture and adjust the watering schedule accordingly. I designed the hardware using Arduino, connected it to the internet, and built a responsive mobile app to control the system. It was amazing to see how I could bring together my love for machine learning, programming, and gardening to create something practical and innovative. It's a project that's still in progress, but it's given me some incredible experience. I'm thrilled to dive into the world of AR/VR and artificial intelligence. In the next 10 years, I envision creating immersive experiences that revolutionize the way we interact with information and each other. Imagine attending virtual concerts where the ambiance and energy of the real thing come alive in your living room. I'd love to be part of developing AI-powered tools that help humanity overcome complex challenges, like disease diagnosis or sustainable energy solutions. The potential is endless, and I'm excited to explore the boundaries of what's possible with technology. It's a tantalizing prospect!
