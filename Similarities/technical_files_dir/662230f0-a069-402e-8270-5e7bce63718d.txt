I just loved working on a project that combined my love for Design and Blockchain! It was a sustainable energy trading platform I built during a hackathon. I used Figma to design the UI, and then collaborated with some awesome teammates to develop it using Rust and React Native. We even did a market test and received really positive feedback. What I enjoyed the most was seeing how our idea could make a real impact on the environment and hearing from others who were passionate about the same cause. It was an incredible experience, and I learned so much! As I look ahead, I'm really passionate about developing innovative solutions that empower marginalized communities. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to work on building a blockchain-based platform that utilizes computer vision and AI to facilitate sustainable energy access in rural areas. By leveraging React Native and Figma, I envision creating a user-friendly interface that enables community members to monitor and control their energy consumption, earning them cryptocurrency-based rewards for eco-friendly habits. It's a daunting task, but I believe it's within my grasp, and I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my vision.
