One project that comes to mind is a personal project I worked on, aReact Native app for people with visually impaired individuals. I was tasked with creating an app that could help them navigate everyday situations more efficiently. I used Computer Vision and Machine Learning to recognize objects, read out texts, and even detect obstacles. It was an amazing experience to see how this app could make a real difference in people's lives. I'm really passionate about the intersection of cyber security and education, and I'd love to work on developing an AI-powered educational platform that's specifically designed to teach children how to code securely. The goal would be to raise the next generation of digitally savvy kids who know how to protect themselves online and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. I envision a platform that's both fun and challenging, with interactive challenges and games that teach coding concepts while also promoting digital responsibility and safety. It's a tall order, but I think it's an area that needs attention, and I'd love to be a part of shaping the future of cyber-ed education!
