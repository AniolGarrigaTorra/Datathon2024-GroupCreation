I've always loved working on designing and building a mobile app for my favorite bookstore! As a bookworm, I wanted to create a way to help customers discover new books and authors. I used Figma to design the UI/UX, and then built the app using iOS Development. It was such a great feeling to see my idea come to life, and I loved getting feedback from friends and family who were able to use the app. It was a non-technical project, but it gave me a taste of entrepreneurship and problem-solving, which I'm excited to apply to my upcoming datathon project! As I dive into this datathon, I'm reminded of my passion for retail and innovation. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing AI-powered personalized shopping experiences that revolutionize the way we shop. I envision an AI-assisted store assistant that learns our preferences and makes tailored recommendations in real-time. I'd love to integrate it with existing e-commerce platforms, creating a seamless and immersive experience. Who knows, maybe I'll even start my own retail-tech company! The prospect of shaping the future of retail and making a dent in the industry keeps me pumped and motivated to crush this datathon!
