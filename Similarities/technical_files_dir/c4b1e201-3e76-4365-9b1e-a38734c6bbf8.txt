I've had the privilege of working on a side project that combined two of my passions - music and data visualization! I created an interactive dashboard that generated stunning visualizations of music recommendations based on users' listening habits. Using Python, Dash, and a Spotify API, I developed an app that suggested new music tracks based on users' preferences. I loved seeing how users' eyes widened as they discovered new songs they loved. It was an incredible feeling seeing people connect with music through data. I even ended up performing at a local music event, showcasing my project - that was an ultimate thrill! I'm really stoked about the idea of applying machine learning and data science to solve some of the world's most pressing social and environmental challenges! In the next decade, I envision myself working on projects that leverage AI to improve healthcare outcomes, promote sustainable energy solutions, and enhance food security. For instance, developing predictive algorithms to anticipate and prevent natural disasters or building robust recommender systems to recommend more effective interventions for endangered species. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to join forces with fellow data enthusiasts to drive positive change!
