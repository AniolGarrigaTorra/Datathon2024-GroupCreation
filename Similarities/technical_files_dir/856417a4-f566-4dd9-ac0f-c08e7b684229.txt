I had a blast working on a project to build a chatbot for a local café using Flutter and Natural Language Processing. I designed the UI/UX and built the foundation of the bot using PyTorch, which allowed me to integrate machine learning functionality. The best part was seeing the bot come to life and interact with customers, learning and improving its responses based on user feedback. It was an amazing experience combining my passion for design, coding, and problem-solving to create something that made a real difference for the café and its customers. I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on a Fintech project that uses AI and Blockchain technology to create a seamless, autonomous investing platform for beginners. My goal is to design an app that not only educates users about investing but also allows them to start investing with a minimal amount of money, empowering them to take control of their financial futures. I'm excited about the potential to make a meaningful impact on people's lives through technology and innovative thinking. It's a lofty goal, but I believe the possibilities are endless!
