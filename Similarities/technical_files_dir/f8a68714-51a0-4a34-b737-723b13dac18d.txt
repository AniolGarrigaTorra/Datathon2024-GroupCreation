One project that I really enjoyed working on was creating a chatbot for a gaming community I'm part of. I used NLP to allow users to interact with the bot and Docker to deploy it on the platform. I learned a lot about natural language processing and the bot turned out to be really useful for gamers, helping them find specific games or teammates. I also got to integrate some fun elements like voice feedback and AR visuals, which added a cool factor. Seeing users enjoy the chatbot and getting feedback on its usefulness was a great feeling! I'm thrilled to share that I've been fascinated by the potential of using artificial intelligence to improve health outcomes, particularly in developing regions. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on a project that leverages AI and data visualization to create a robust telemedicine platform for remote communities. With a user-friendly interface and personalized diagnosis tools, this platform could increase access to quality healthcare and reduce healthcare disparities. My dream is to be part of a team that develops this innovative solution, empowering communities worldwide to take control of their health and well-being.
