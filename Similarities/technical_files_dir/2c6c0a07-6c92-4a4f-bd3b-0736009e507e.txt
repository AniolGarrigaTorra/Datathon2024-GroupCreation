One project that stands out is my final project for my Intro to Computer Vision course. I built a web-based AI-powered coffee shop recommender system using TensorFlow and Flutter. I trained a machine learning model to classify coffee shop reviews based on sentiments, and then integrated it with a Flutter app to provide users with personalized coffee shop recommendations. I loved seeing how my skills in computer vision, machine learning, and web development came together to create something practical and fun. Plus, who doesn't love coffee? It was a great way to apply my technical skills to something tangible and user-friendly. I'm thrilled to say that I'm passionate about creating AI-powered, educational robots that can teach coding skills to underprivileged children. I believe that every child deserves access to quality education, and technology can be a game-changer in making that possible. With my skills in Computer Vision and TensorFlow, I'd love to design robots that can detect and correct pupil errors, providing personalized learning experiences. Imagine a future where kids from all backgrounds can code their own futures, equipped with cutting-edge tools and mentorship. It's a lofty goal, but one that gets me pumped to work on it every day!
