I had a blast working on a Computer Vision project where I used OpenCV to create a facial recognition system for a friend's startup. It was a cool experience to explore the world of machine learning and see my code come to life! I was amazed by how well it worked, even on a small dataset. It was also super rewarding to see my friend's excitement and encouragement. The best part? I learned so much from it and can apply those skills to future projects. I'm still thinking about ways to improve it and add new features! I'm absolutely stoked about the prospect of creating innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact. Over the next decade, I envision being part of a team that develops AI-powered tools to bridge the financial gap for underserved communities. Using blockchain and cybersecurity expertise, we'll design a platform that enables efficient, secure, and accessible financial transactions, empowering people worldwide. With my experience in computer vision and flutter development, I'm excited to leverage my skills to build augmented reality interfaces that provide education and resources to these communities. The thought of being part of this transformative journey keeps me up at night, and I can't wait to get started!
