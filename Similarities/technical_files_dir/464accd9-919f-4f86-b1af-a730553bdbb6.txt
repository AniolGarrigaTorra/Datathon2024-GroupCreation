One project that really stands out to me was a side project I did over the summer. I decided to try my hand at building a mobile app to help manage and track my gaming streaming sessions using SwiftUI and iOS development. I really enjoyed the challenge of learning a new framework and designing a user-friendly interface. Seeing the app come together was such a thrill! I even involved my friends and we used it to track our gaming marathons. It was an amazing feeling to see something I built being used and loved by others. I'm incredibly excited to work on developing personalized financial management systems that utilize AI and machine learning to help individuals make informed decisions about their money. Imagine having an app that integrates with your accounts, recognizes your spending habits, and provides tailored suggestions to improve your financial health. As someone fascinated by Fintech and DevOps, I'd love to contribute to projects that bridge the gap between data analysis and real-world applications. In the next 10 years, I envision a future where technology empowers people to take control of their finances and build a better financial future.
