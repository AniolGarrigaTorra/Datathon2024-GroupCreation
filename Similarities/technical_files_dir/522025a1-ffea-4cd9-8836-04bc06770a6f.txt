One project that stands out to me is an Augmented Reality experience I built for my college's healthcare festival. We wanted to raise awareness about mental health, and I created an interactive AR filter that used facial recognition and machine learning to detect emotions. Participants would record a video of themselves, and the filter would respond with personalized mental wellness tips and resources. I loved how it combined my passions for AR, computer vision, and health! Seeing people's reactions when they used it was amazing, and it was incredible to know I was helping spread a positive message. As a futurist at heart, I'm thrilled to envision a reality where artificial intelligence has revolutionized the healthcare industry. In the next 10 years, I hope to work on developing a comprehensive platform that utilizes machine learning and computer vision to facilitate early disease detection and personalized treatments. Imagine patients undergoing non-invasive scanning and diagnostic procedures that provide accurate results in real-time. This would enable targeted interventions, reduce medical costs, and most importantly, improve patient outcomes. The prospect of harnessing technology to positively impact people's lives is what drives me to push the boundaries of innovation.
