Oh, oh! I'm so excited to talk about this! I worked on a project that combined my passion for Fintech and IoT - I built a smart wallet using Arduino and some creative problem-solving. It was a blast! I designed a modular wallet that could integrate with my phone via Bluetooth, allowing me to track my expenses in real-time. It was amazing to see how a simple idea could come to life, and I loved the sense of accomplishment when I showed it off to friends and family. Who knew learning could be so much fun?! I'm thrilled to think about the future, and what I'm most looking forward to working on in the next 10 years is the fusion of Fintech and AR/VR. I envision creating an immersive, gamified financial planning platform that helps individuals and families make smart investment decisions, stay on top of their expenses, and set achievable financial goals. The AR/VR element would enable users to visualize their financial data in a stunning, 3D environment, making complex concepts more accessible and engaging. It's an ambitious project, but I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with finance.
