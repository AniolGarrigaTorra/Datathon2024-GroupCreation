I'm Catherine Élise, and my objective for this datathon is to dive head-first into the world of data analysis and learn as much as I can. With a solid foundation in programming, I want to challenge myself to learn new tools and techniques, and gain practical experience working with datasets. I'm not focused on winning - I just want to take home new skills and a better understanding of what I'm capable of. My goal is to learn by doing, and make the most of this experience to take my skills to the next level! Hey! I'm Catherine Élise, a third-year student with a passion for technology and creativity.
