For this datathon, my goal is to absorb as much as I can. I'm looking to level up my programming skills, especially in machine learning and data visualization. I'm hoping to dive into some new technologies and methodologies, and come out with some tangible skills to take back to my studies. I'm not worried too much about winning, as long as I'm pushing myself and learning something new each day. Fingers crossed I'll come away with some fresh ideas and confidence to take on bigger projects in the future! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a third-year student with a passion for using tech to solve real-world problems. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I'm hoping to level up my skills and learn some new tricks. I've been experimenting with programming for a few years now, and I've developed a fascination with how we can use code to bring ideas to life. I'm all about that #learnin vibe, and I'm looking forward to collaborating with other like-minded folks and seeing what kind of awesome projects we can create!
