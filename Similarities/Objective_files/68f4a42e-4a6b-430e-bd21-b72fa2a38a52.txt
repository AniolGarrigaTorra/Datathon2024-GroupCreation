Hey, I'm Lena! For this datathon, my goal is to soak up as much new knowledge and skill-building as possible. I've participated in a couple of hackathons before, but I know I still have a lot to learn, especially when it comes to data wrangling and visualization. I'd love to learn new tools, techniques, and strategies from industry experts and fellow participants, and improve my coding skills by tackling real-world problems. Ultimately, I'm here to challenge myself and grow as a developer, and have fun along the way! Hey everyone! I'm Lena, a 21-year-old student and coding enthusiast. I'm in my fourth year of studies and have been programming for a few years now. While I've dabbled in various technologies, I'm most passionate about creating innovative solutions that make a real impact. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring the intersections of technology and health, as well as experimenting with machine learning and data visualization. For this datathon, I'm looking to take on new challenges and learn from the best in the industry.
