I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon! I'm not really here to win or focus on being the best, I just want to have a blast with like-minded people. I'm all about making new friends and having a fun experience. I'd love to learn some new skills, but I'm happy to do it at my own pace and not stress too much about perfection. My goal is to participate in as many events as I can, take part in awesome challenges, and just soak up the datathon atmosphere. I'm ready to let loose and have the time of my life! Hey there! I'm Nuria, a 18-year-old student with a passion for creative problem-solving and exploring new tech frontiers. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon, where I can connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and learn from each other's experiences. I'm all about making memories and having a blast while doing it! When I'm not coding, you can find me on YouTube, binge-watching AI and ML tutorials or exploring new AR games. I'm looking forward to being part of this amazing community and sharing some laughter and fun along the way!
