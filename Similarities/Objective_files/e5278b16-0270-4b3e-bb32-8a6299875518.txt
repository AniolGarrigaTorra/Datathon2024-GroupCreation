Hey! As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to join this datathon to learn as much as I can and take my skills to the next level. I'm aiming to improve my expertise in machine learning and data visualization, and I'd love to work on projects that push me outside of my comfort zone. I'm hoping to take away new knowledge, techniques, and ideas that I can apply to my future projects and maybe even help my fellow participants grow too. Bring on the challenges and opportunities to learn - I'm ready to soak it all in! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lia, a curious and enthusiastic student with a passion for creating innovative tech solutions. I've been dabbling in programming for a few years now, and I'm hooked on machine learning and AI. I love exploring new ways to tell stories with data and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I'm also into blockchain and design, which keeps my creative juices flowing. Outside of class, you can find me messing around with code, or designing something new in Figma. I'm super stoked to be here, and I'm looking forward to the amazing challenges and opportunities that this datathon has to offer!
