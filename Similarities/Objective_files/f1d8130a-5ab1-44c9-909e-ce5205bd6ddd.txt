Hey, I'm Alessandra! As a 4th-year student with a programming background, I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon. My objective is to dive head-first into this challenge and learn as much as I can about data analysis and visualization. I'm looking to level up my skills in tools like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and get a better grasp on machine learning concepts. My goal is to walk away from this event with new techniques to add to my toolkit and a deeper understanding of data storytelling. Can't wait to geek out with fellow participants and mentors! Hey there! I'm Alessandra, a 4th-year student with a passion for programming. I've spent the past few years diving into coding, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. As a bit of a data geek, I love unraveling stories hidden within numbers and finding creative ways to present my findings. Outside of code, I'm also an art junkie and music lover. Can't wait to geek out with fellow participants and learn from the best in the field!
