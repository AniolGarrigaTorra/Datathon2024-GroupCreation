My objective for this datathon is to soak up the energy and vibe of the event. I'm all about making new connections, learning from others, and having a blast while doing it. I'm not too concerned about winning or even taking home a prize - I just want to participate in as many activities as I can, from workshops to hackathons to networking sessions. My goal is to come out with some awesome new friends and stories to share with my friends back home. Sounds like a recipe for an epic adventure to me! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a masters student with a passion for innovation and collaboration. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon, where I can immerse myself in a creative and dynamic atmosphere. With a background in programming and design, I'm always looking for new ways to bring people together through tech. My ultimate goal is to make meaningful connections and take home some unforgettable experiences. Let's create something amazing together!
