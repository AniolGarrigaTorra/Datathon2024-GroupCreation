For me, this datathon is all about the vibes! I'm excited to soak up a weekend of hackery with like-minded people, make some new buddies, and have a blast doing it. I don't worry too much about winning or even coming up with a revolutionary project - I'd rather focus on learning some cool new tech skills, attending rad workshops and talks, and just enjoying the ride. And hey, who knows, maybe I'll even snag some swag prizes along the way! Hey, I'm Ava! I'm an 18-year-old student on a quest for learning and adventure. When I'm not attending classes, you can find me tinkering with tech, exploring new hobbies, or binge-watching my favorite shows. I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon, where I can geek out with like-minded folks, learn new skills, and make unforgettable memories. My goals are simple: have fun, network, and come away with fresh insights and ideas. Bring on the caffeine, coding, and camaraderie - it's gonna be an epic weekend!
