As a third-year computer science student, I'm stoked to participate in this datathon! My goal is to have a blast with fellow participants and make some awesome new friends. I want to dive into different challenges and activities, trying my hand at everything from data science sprints to industry workshops. I'm all about learning and growing, but more importantly, I just want to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the ride. I'm ready to geek out, have some laughs, and take away memories and experiences that will last way longer than my 0.02 seconds of screen time. Hey there! I'm Ari√† Sutherland, a third-year computer science student and a total newbie when it comes to datathons. I'm excited to jump into this whirlwind of data science sprints, industry workshops, and fellow hackers. When I'm not coding, you can find me scouring the web for lifehacks or experimenting with enterprise solutions. I'm all about growing, learning, and making unforgettable memories with my new friends. This datathon is the perfect chance for me to geek out, share some laughs, and soak up the atmosphere. I'm ready to dive in and make this an experience to remember!
