My goal for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and connect with fellow participants. I'm hoping to have some amazing conversations, form new friendships, and learn from others' approaches to solving the challenges. I also want to try out new programming skills and technologies, but only in a way that's super relaxed and not too competitive. My top priority is to enjoy the experience, be social, and take in all the atmosphere and energy the datathon has to offer. Hey everyone! I'm Leonharda, a 21-year-old student with a passion for learning and collaboration. I'm currently in my 4th year of studies, and I'm excited to take a break from my books to join this datathon. I'm all about making connections and sharing experiences, so I'm looking forward to having some amazing conversations and forming new friendships. I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, and I love exploring new technologies and programming languages. Above all, I'm here to soak up the energy and have a blast with all of you!
