Hey! I'm Alexis. For this datathon, I'm all about having a blast with like-minded people. I want to meet new friends, attend all the awesome events they'll have, and enjoy the vibe. I'm not too worried about winning or even being super awesome at coding - I'm more excited about collaborating with others, trying new challenges, and learning from everyone's expertise. I hope to make some unforgettable memories with the community, and maybe, just maybe, come out with some fresh skills and ideas to boot! Bring it on! Hey, I'm Alexis!
