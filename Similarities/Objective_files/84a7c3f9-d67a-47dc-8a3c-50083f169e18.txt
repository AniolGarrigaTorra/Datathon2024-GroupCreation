I'm Luna Sophia, and I'm here to crush this datathon! My ultimate goal is to win, and I'll stop at nothing to make it happen. I've been in three hackathons before, and I'm familiar with the adrenaline rush that comes with competing against the best. I'm excited to take on this challenge and push myself to my limits. Expect me to be fully engaged, laser-focused, and fueled by caffeine and determination. Bring it on, datathon, I'm ready to take you down! Hi! I'm Luna Sophia, a third-year student with a passion for tech and competition. I'm always fueled by a need to learn and a drive to win. I've been in three hackathons before, and I'm hooked on the rush of adrenaline that comes with building something new and beating the clock. Outside of coding, you can find me jamming out to music or painting. For this datathon, I'm all about crushing it and taking it to the next level. Expect me to be 100% engaged, focused, and caffeinated. Let's do this!
