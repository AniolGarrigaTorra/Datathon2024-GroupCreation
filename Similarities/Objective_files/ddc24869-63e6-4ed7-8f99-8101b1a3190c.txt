My main objective for this datathon is to gain as much knowledge as possible and improve my programming skills. I've had some experience at two previous hackathons, but I know there's still so much more to learn. I'm excited to be surrounded by experts and industry professionals, and I'm hoping to take away some practical tips and tricks to apply to my projects back in university. I'm happy to work in teams and collaborate with others, but ultimately, I'm here to challenge myself and come away with a newfound level of proficiency in data science. Hey, I'm Lena Flynn! I'm a 20-year-old student just diving into the world of data science. In my second year of university, I'm eager to continue learning and expanding my skillset. I've had some hands-on experience with programming and hackathons, but I know there's always more to discover. As someone who loves staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends, I'm excited to meet like-minded individuals and soak up new knowledge. I'm here to push myself, learn from others, and make meaningful connections - and I'm already excited to see what the weekend brings!
