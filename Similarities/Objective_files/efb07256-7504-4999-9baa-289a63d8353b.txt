Hey! I'm Sophia, and my objective for this datathon is to make new friends, have an awesome time, and participate in as many cool events as possible. I'm all about the social benefits - I figure that's where some of the best connections and opportunities come from! Don't get me wrong, I'll still give it my all when it comes to the challenges, but my main goal is to soak up the datathon vibes, learn from my fellow competitors, and make some lasting memories. See you around! Hi everyone! I'm Sophia, a 21-year-old student who's always on the lookout for new experiences and connections. I'm a curious problem-solver with a passion for innovation, and I'm excited to be a part of this datathon. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in blockchain or AI, or creating art that combines music and technology. I'm all about learning from others and making meaningful relationships - so let's swap stories and ideas!
