Hey! I'm Pilar, and I'm excited to participate in this datathon. My main objective is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills in programming. I'm just starting out in my degree and this event will be a great opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience and learn from other experienced developers. I want to take the challenge as a chance to boost my confidence and build a solid foundation in data science and programming. I'm looking forward to absorbing as much knowledge as I can and come out of this event a better programmer than when I started! Hi! I'm Pilar, a first-year student with a thirst for coding adventures. I'm excited to dive into the world of data science through this datathon. With a beginner's zeal, I'm eager to learn, make mistakes, and grow. My passion for gaming has gotten me hooked on data-driven problem-solving, and I'm curious to see how it translates to real-world scenarios. This event is a fantastic opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience, challenge myself, and become a more confident programmer. Bring on the challenges!
