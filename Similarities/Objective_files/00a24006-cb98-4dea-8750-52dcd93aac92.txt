Hey there! I'm Lluís, and my main goal for this datathon is to win it. I've participated in a hackathon before and loved the thrill of racing against the clock to come up with a solid project. I've honed my programming skills to an Intermediate level, but I'm eager to take it to the next level. This datathon provides the perfect challenge for me to push myself to create something truly innovative and impactful. My objective is simple: work diligently, solve the challenges efficiently, and do everything in my power to emerge victorious. Bring it on! Hi there! I'm Lluís Finch, a 21-year-old student with a passion for solving problems and pushing boundaries. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm usually jamming to my favorite tunes or getting lost in the world of gaming. After experiencing the rush of a hackathon, I'm hooked - nothing beats the thrill of racing against time to turn ideas into reality! I'm all about creating something that makes a difference, and I'm excited to put my skills to the test and see what I can come up with in this datathon.
