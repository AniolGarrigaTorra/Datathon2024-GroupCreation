My objective is simple: I want to have a blast and soak up all the excitement the datathon has to offer! As a fourth-year student, I've had my fair share of intense projects and competitive hackathons, but now it's time to relax and just enjoy the ride. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, hearing their stories, and learning from their experiences. My goal is to attend as many workshops, panels, and networking sessions as possible, and even collaborate on a fun side project or two. Hey there! I'm Isabel, a 21-year-old student who's all about learning and growing. I've been coding for a while now and have had my fair share of awesome projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new lifehacks or checking out the latest blockchain developments. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, where I can meet new people, share stories, and learn from their experiences. I'm all about having fun and soaking up the excitement - and maybe even stumbling upon some new adventures!
