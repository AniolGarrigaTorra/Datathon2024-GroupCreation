Hey! As a relatively new programmer, I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! For me, the main goal is to step up my game and learn as much as I can. I want to explore new languages, frameworks, and tools to improve my skills and gain more confidence in my abilities. I'm hoping to work on projects that push me outside my comfort zone and allow me to grow as a developer. Let's see what I can learn and create during these 24 hours! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 2nd-year student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm excited to be part of this datathon, where I can unleash my creativity and push my skills to the next level.
