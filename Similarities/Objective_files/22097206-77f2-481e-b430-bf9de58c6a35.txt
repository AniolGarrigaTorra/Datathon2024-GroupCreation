Hey, I'm Agnieszka! For this datathon, my objective is to focus on the fun factor. I'm all about making new friends, learning new skills, and experiencing the energy of the event. I've done my fair share of hackathons, but this time I want to explore different aspects of data science, participate in creative workshops, and chill with fellow participants. I'd love to take part in as many events as possible, from tech talks to team-building exercises. Let's do this and have a blast together! Hey everyone! I'm Agnieszka, but feel free to call me Aggie. I'm a 4th-year student with a passion for innovation and creativity. I've been around the block with coding and hackathons, but I'm here to shake things up and try something new. I love exploring unconventional data approaches and bringing art and music into the mix. This datathon, I'm all about making memories, learning alongside awesome peers, and having a blast. Whether it's data viz, workshops, or jamming with fellow participants, I'm excited to be here and soak up the vibes!
