Hey! I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! For me, this event is all about making new friends and having a blast while doing it. I've never been to a hackathon before, but I've heard it's an amazing way to meet like-minded people and learn new skills. That's all cool and good, but for me, the priority is just having fun and enjoying the experience. I want to participate in as many events and activities as possible, take in as much as I can, and just soak up the energy. Let's make some awesome memories! Hey there! I'm Avery, a second-year student with a passion for making new connections and having a blast. When I'm not hitting the books, I love designing solutions and making things that bring people together. I've heard great things about datathons and can't wait to meet others who share my enthusiasm. For me, this event is all about making memories and learning new things along the way. Expect to find me taking part in all the activities, asking lots of questions, and soaking up the fun vibes!
