My goal for this datathon is to make some amazing friends and have the time of my life! I want to let my hair down, geek out with like-minded folks, and learn some new skills on the side. I'm looking forward to participating in as many events as I can, from tech talks to workshops, and maybe even some hack challenges to get those endorphins pumping. As long as I'm having fun and meeting awesome people, I'll be a happy participant! Hey there! I'm Carme MÃ²nica, a 21-year-old third-year student, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. When I'm not studying, you can find me exploring new technologies or brainstorming innovative ideas that can make a positive impact. I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, always looking for opportunities to geek out and learn from others. My goal for this event is to have a blast while meeting fellow enthusiasts, attending workshops, and maybe even sparking a new idea or two. Ready to dance the night away with my new friends!
