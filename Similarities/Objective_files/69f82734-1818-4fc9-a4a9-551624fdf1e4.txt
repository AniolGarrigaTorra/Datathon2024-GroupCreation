My objective for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge and skills as possible. As a 2nd-year student, I'm still trying to wrap my head around advanced programming concepts, and I think this event is the perfect opportunity to challenge myself and gain hands-on experience. I'm excited to collaborate with other datathon participants and learn from their perspectives, approaches, and strengths. I'm looking forward to taking home practical skills and expertise that I can apply to my future projects and, who knows, maybe even develop some ideas and projects along the way! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, an 18-year-old student on a quest for programming mastery. As a 2nd-year student, I'm constantly seeking ways to grow and challenge myself. I've had some exposure to programming, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level. I'm passionate about making a mark in the world of E-commerce and Retail, and I believe datathon will provide the perfect platform for me to achieve that. My goal for this event is to learn as much as I can, be inspired by others, and take away practical skills to boost my future projects!
