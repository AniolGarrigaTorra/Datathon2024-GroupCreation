I'm all about spreading good vibes and making the most of this datathon! My goal is to connect with like-minded folks, learn new things alongside them, and have an absolute blast while doing it. I'm not here to stress about winning - that's not my jam. Instead, I want to participate in as many events as I can, attend some awesome talks, and make friends who share my passion for data and tech. Let's do this, and have an amazing time doing it! Hey there! I'm Ava Reynolds, a 19-year-old student who's all about spreading positivity and having a blast. When I'm not crushing it in class, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or hacking away on a project that makes a difference. I'm a total people person and can't wait to meet fellow data enthusiasts. My goal for this datathon? To make unforgettable connections, learn alongside amazing folks, and soak up every awesome talk and event that comes our way. Ready to rock this datathon with some fellow go-getters?
