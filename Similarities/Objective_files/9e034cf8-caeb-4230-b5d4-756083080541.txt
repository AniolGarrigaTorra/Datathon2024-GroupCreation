Hey, I'm Rosa! For this datathon, my objective is to come out with a learning mentality. I want to dive deeper into data analysis and try new tools to enhance my skills. I'd love to challenge myself to build complex projects and troubleshoot problems. I'm not particularly worried about winning or taking the top spot, but I do hope to get exposure to new data manipulation techniques and frameworks. By the end of this datathon, I'd like to feel confident in taking on more ambitious projects and having a fresh perspective to approach data science problems. Hi! I'm Rosa Pujol Estivill, a third-year student with a passion for solving problems using code. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and enjoy diving into complex projects. In my free time, I love tinkering with data manipulation and analysis. I'm all about continuous learning, which is why I'm super excited to participate in this datathon. My goal is to develop my skills, take on new projects, and gain fresh perspectives. I'm not necessarily looking for the top spot, but I hope to have fun and push myself to learn and grow as a data enthusiast.
