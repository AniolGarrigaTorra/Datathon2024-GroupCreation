My objective for this datathon is to come out on top and take home that coveted trophy. I'm all about going in with a strategy and executing it to perfection. I'll be dedicating every waking moment to working on our project, making sure it's bug-free and packed with innovative features. My goal is to be one of the first three to present and have our project stand out from the crowd. If I play my cards right, I'm hoping to bring home the grand prize and make my university friends proud. Win or die trying, that's my motto! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a 21-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems through code. With a solid foundation in programming and experience in designing innovative solutions, I'm excited to take on the challenges of this datathon. I'm a perfectionist who thrives under pressure, and my goal is to craft a project that stands out from the crowd. Outside of coding, you can find me experimenting with DIY projects, creating digital art, or jamming to my favorite tunes. Bring on the caffeine and let's make some magic happen!
