I'm looking forward to collaborating on fun projects, attending exciting events, and maybe even learning some new skills along the way. But most importantly, I want to meet fellow datathon-ers, build connections, and create lifelong friendships. Bring on the laughter, challenges, and memories - it's going to be an epic adventure! Hey everyone! I'm Aurélie, a 20-year-old student and self-proclaimed tech enthusiast. I'm stoked to be here, diving into the world of data and innovation.
