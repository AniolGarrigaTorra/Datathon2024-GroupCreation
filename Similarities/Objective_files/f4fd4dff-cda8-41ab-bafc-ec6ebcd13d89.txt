Hi there! I'm Lara Margarita Esteller, a 19-year-old student in my first year of computer science. As a beginner in programming, I'm super excited to participate in this datathon to learn new things and improve my skills. My objective is to take this opportunity to explore different areas of data analysis and manipulation, attend workshops and tutorials, and learn from experienced mentors and peers. I hope to leave this event with a fresh set of skills, new perspectives, and a better understanding of how to apply data insights in real-world scenarios. Wish me luck! Hey everyone! I'm Lara, a 19-year-old computer science student in my first year. As a beginner in programming, I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I've got a passion for making a difference in the world through data and technology. I love solving problems and learning new things, and I'm looking forward to meeting like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm. When I'm not coding, you can find me creating music or art. I'm a bit quirky, but I'm here to have fun and learn from the best! Nice to meet you all!
