Hey, I'm Lucas! For this datathon, I'm not super competitive - I'm all about having a good time and making new connections. I'd love to be part of a great team, tackle some awesome challenges, and attend plenty of cool events. I want to walk away with a bunch of new friendships and memories, even if we don't take home the top prize. I'm excited to learn some new stuff and have a blast doing it! So, bring on the networking opportunities, parties, and hacktastic fun - I'm ready to get my datathon on! Hey, I'm Lucas! I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for making a difference. In my free time, I love exploring the intersection of technology and design, trying to come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm all about that creative hacker life, always looking for new ways to solve puzzles and make connections. For this datathon, I'm excited to collaborate with others, learn from each other, and create something amazing. I'm a team player, so let's crush some challenges and have an epic time doing it!
