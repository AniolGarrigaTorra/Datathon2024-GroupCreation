Hey! My goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and gain valuable experience. I'm excited to learn new things and tackle challenges that push me out of my comfort zone. I'm not necessarily looking to win (although it'd be awesome if I did!) but rather to get my hands dirty with some fresh data and cutting-edge tools. I want to come out of this event with new skills, fresh ideas, and a bunch of cool project ideas to work on when I get back to my studies. Hey there! I'm Astrid, a third-year student who's always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I've dabbled in programming for a while now, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. Outside of classes, you can find me tinkering with digital things and daydreaming about building something that can make a real impact. My goal for this datathon is to push myself outside of my comfort zone, pick up some new tricks, and come out with fresh ideas to tackle after I get back to school. It'll be great to meet you all and see what cool stuff we can create together!
