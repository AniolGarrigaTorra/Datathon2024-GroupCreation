Hey, I'm Aurélien! For this datathon, my objective is all about soaking up the experience and having a blast. I want to meet fellow enthusiasts, learn about new trends and tools, and basically, have an amazing time. No pressure to win - I'll just focus on participating in as many events as I can, and maybe even discover some new areas that spark my interest. I'm all about growing, learning, and socializing, so this datathon is a perfect excuse to push outside my comfort zone and make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Aurélien, a 21-year-old student eager to dive into the datathon adventure. Currently in my third year of university, I'm excited to explore new trends and technologies. I'm passionate about innovation and using data to drive positive change. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me messing around with mobile development or experimenting with AR/VR projects. I'm all about learning, growth, and having a blast, so I'm stoked to be here! Let's grab a cup of coffee and chat about all things data!
