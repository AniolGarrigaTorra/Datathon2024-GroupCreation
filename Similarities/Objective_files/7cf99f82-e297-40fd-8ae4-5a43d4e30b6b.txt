My goal for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and take away awesome memories! I'm super excited to meet new people, learn some new skills, and participate in as many events as I can. I've heard great things about the vibe here, and I'm hoping to absorb as much as possible - and that includes networking and making some new BFFs. I'm not too worried about winning, so I'd love to chill, grab some snacks, and just go with the flow. Let's do this and have some serious fun! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lia Winston, a 19-year-old undergrad who's all about embracing new experiences. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me exploring the world of design and e-commerce. I'm stoked to be at this datathon, where I can soak up some fresh skills and connect with like-minded folk. I'm all about trying new things and making memorable moments, so I'm not too worried about winning - just about having a blast and making some sweet memories. Let's keep it chill, have some laughs, and create some awesome times together!
