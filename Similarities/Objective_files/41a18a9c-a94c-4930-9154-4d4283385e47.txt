Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to soak up the experience and make the most of it. I'm all about having fun and meeting new people! I'm excited to participate in as many events as I can, from workshops to competitions, and just enjoy the atmosphere. I'd love to collaborate with others on projects, learn new skills and tricks, and make lasting connections. I'm not super competitive, so winning isn't the top priority for me - it's about the ride, the friends, and the memories. Hey there! I'm Evelyn Ruby Jackson, a 20-year-old student excited to be here at the datathon. I'm a curious and adventurous person who loves learning new things and exploring different ideas. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with technology to make my life easier and more fun. I'm all about collaboration, making new friends, and having a blast. I'm not super focused on winning, but more about the experiences, connections, and memories I'll take away from this event. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you and seeing what this datathon has in store!
