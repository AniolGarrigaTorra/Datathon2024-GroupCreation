Hey! As a third-year student with a passion for programming, I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon. My objective is to dive deep into learning new skills and improving my existing ones. I've got a solid foundation in programming, but I'm eager to expand my knowledge and get exposure to emerging tech trends. I'd love to pick up some new tools, work on projects that challenge me, and get feedback from fellow enthusiasts. At the end of the datathon, I hope to leave with a refreshed sense of excitement and a springboard for growth as a developer. Hey, I'm Emily! I'm a 21-year-old computer science student, currently in my third year. I've had the privilege of exploring programming since my early university days, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level during this datathon. I'm eager to expand my knowledge of emerging tech trends and tackle projects that push me out of my comfort zone. With a background in mobile app development and database management, I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and learning from them. My goal is to leave this datathon feeling revitalized and empowered to continue growing as a developer.
