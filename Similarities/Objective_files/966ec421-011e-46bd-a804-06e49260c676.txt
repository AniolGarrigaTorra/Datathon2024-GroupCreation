For this datathon, I'm aiming to prioritize my learning and skills development. As a student, I've had some decent experience with programming, but I know there's still a lot for me to absorb. I want to dive deep into the project challenges and learn from the feedback I receive. I'm excited to collaborate with others and pick up new techniques, tools, and approaches that will help me grow both personally and professionally. Above all, I'm looking forward to the chance to refine my problem-solving skills and bring a new level of expertise to the projects I work on. Hi there! I'm Aur√©lie Englishwood, a third-year student who's been tinkering with code for a few years now. I've got a passion for building innovative solutions and am always up for a challenge. I'm excited to join this datathon and take my skills to the next level. I'm all about collaboration and love learning from others. With a mix of web development and machine learning experience under my belt, I'm confident I'll bring a unique perspective to the projects we'll be working on. I'm looking forward to diving in and seeing what creative solutions we can come up with!
