My goal for this datathon is to come out on top and claim the win. I'm all about competition and pushing myself to the limit. I've participated in five hackathons so far, and I've always aimed to impress. I'm looking to apply the programming skills I've honed in my third year of degree studies to outdo the competition and take home the prize. I'm not here to make friends or just have fun (although, that's a bonus, of course!). My sights are set on that first-place trophy, and I won't stop until I get it. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lie, a third-year student always up for a challenge. I thrive in high-pressure environments and live for the rush of competition. I've got a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and datathon is the perfect arena to do just that. With a background in computer programming and a knack for innovation, I'm here to take home the win. No friendships, no casual fun - my sights are set on that top prize. I'm ready to bring my A-game, and I won't rest until I've got that trophy in my hands. Bring it on!
