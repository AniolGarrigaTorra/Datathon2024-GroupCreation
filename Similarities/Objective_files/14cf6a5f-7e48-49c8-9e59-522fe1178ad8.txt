Hey! My objective for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and have an absolute blast. I'm all about learning new things and networking, but I'm more interested in the social aspect and having fun with my fellow participants. I'm hoping to take advantage of all the events, workshops, and activities the datathon has to offer, and meet some amazing people who share similar interests. I'm looking forward to sharing laughter, creating memories, and making new friends! Hey there! I'm Alessandra, a 20-year-old student living life to the fullest. I'm in my second year, and I'm all about embracing new experiences. I'm passionate about using tech to drive social impact and make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm excited to join this datathon and connect with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for innovation and collaboration. I'm looking forward to making memories, sharing laughs, and learning from each other as we solve real-world problems and have a blast doing it!
