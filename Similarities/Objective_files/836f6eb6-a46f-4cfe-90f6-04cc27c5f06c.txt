Hey! So I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! My objective is really to make the most of this experience and just have a blast. I'm all about networking and meeting like-minded people, and who knows, maybe we'll come up with some awesome ideas together! I'm excited to participate in all the events, from workshops to challenges, and learn as much as I can along the way. At the end of the day, I just want to have had an epic time with an amazing group of people. Hey there! I'm Astrid, a 22-year-old student excited to be part of this datathon!
