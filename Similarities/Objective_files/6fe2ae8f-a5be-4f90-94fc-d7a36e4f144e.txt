Hey! I'm Giulia, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. My goal for this event is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. As a student, I'm looking to gain hands-on experience with new technologies and datasets, and to challenge myself to think outside the box. I'm not necessarily aiming to win the competition, but rather to take away some valuable knowledge and insights that I can apply to my future projects. Hey there! I'm Giulia, a 22-year-old student buzzing with excitement to be here at the datathon. I'm in my fourth year of studies and have a strong foundation in programming. I'm all about making a positive impact, which is why I'm drawn to initiatives that apply tech to social good. I've developed a passion for robotic process automation and voice skills - it's amazing how these technologies can simplify our lives and bridge communication gaps. I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded folks, learning from their expertise, and taking away new knowledge to apply to my own projects.
