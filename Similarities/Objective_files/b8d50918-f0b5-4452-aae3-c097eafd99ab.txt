I'm Sophia, and my objective for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge as possible! As a 2nd-year student, I'm still building my skills, and I'd love to dive into new technologies and techniques. I'm not worried about winning, but I am excited to learn from the other participants and mentors. My goal is to come out of this datathon with a newfound understanding of machine learning or natural language processing, and to have improved my problem-solving and collaboration skills. Bring on the coding challenges and brain teasers - I'm ready to learn! Hey there! I'm Sophia Patel, a 2nd-year student eager to dive into the world of datathon. I've been playing with code for a while now and love solving puzzles and creating cool projects. My passion lies in building things that can shape the future, which is why I'm fascinated by blockchain and its potential.
