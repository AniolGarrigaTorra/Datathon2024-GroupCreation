As Lilya Wellesley, my objective for this datathon is to have an amazing time with like-minded people. I'm looking to make new friends, learn from others, and soak up the fun atmosphere. I'm not really here to win (although it would be amazing if I did!), but instead I'm hoping to participate in as many events as possible, like workshops, seminars, and maybe even some hack challenges. My goal is to come out of this datathon feeling like I've accomplished something, whether that's solving a project or making some lifelong connections. Bring on the fun! Hey! I'm Lilya, a 19-year-old student and self-proclaimed tech enthusiast. I'm in my second year of university, and I'm just getting my feet wet in the world of programming. I'm passionate about using technology to make everyday life more efficient and fun. I love tinkering with code, designing cool UIs, and experimenting with innovative tools. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me jamming to some sick beats or expressing my artistic side through music and art. I'm super excited to be here, meet new people, and take part in some epic datathon events!
