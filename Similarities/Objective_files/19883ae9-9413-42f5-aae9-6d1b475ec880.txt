Hey! As I dive into this datathon, my objective is to soak up the atmosphere, learn from the experience, and make some awesome friends along the way. I'm all about having a blast and trying new things - whether it's a new programming language or a new social connection! I'm not too fussed about winning (although it'd be a nice bonus!). My priority is to participate in as many events as possible, absorb new skills, and come away with unforgettable memories. See you around the datathon grounds! Hey there! I'm Marta Rovira, a 22-year-old student enthusiast! I'm pumped to be part of this datathon, and I'm looking forward to learning, making new friends, and soaking up the vibe. When I'm not geeking out over tech, I love exploring new languages (programming and human alike!) and discovering hidden gems. With a passion for innovation and creativity, I'm always up for a challenge and love to think outside the box. Here's to new experiences, exciting discussions, and making unforgettable memories!
