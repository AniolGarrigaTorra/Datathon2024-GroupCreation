I'm here to win, plain and simple. As a seasoned hackathon participant, I've got a knack for spotting trends and innovating on the fly. I've come to the datathon to leverage my intermediate programming skills to take on the challenges head-on. I'm all about competing, pushing the boundaries, and seeing what the limits of this datathon are. Expect me to be fully focused on coding, prototyping, and optimizing my solution to be the best. Bring it on! Hi! I'm Leilani, a 20-year-old student with a competitive streak a mile wide. In my third year, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing, and datathons are my jam. With a foundation in programming and a knack for innovating under pressure, I'm all about bringing something new to the table. When I'm not holed up coding away, you can find me jamming on my guitar or exploring the world of AR/VR. For the datathon, I'm ready to dig in, get weird, and see what kind of magic we can make. Let's get this done!
