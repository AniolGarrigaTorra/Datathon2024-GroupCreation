Hey, I'm Léa! For this datathon, my main objective is to level up my skills and make the most out of this intense learning experience. I'm excited to dive into new tech challenges, explore innovative approaches, and refine my programming abilities. I'm not as focused on competing to win, but more on acquiring new knowledge and pushing myself outside my comfort zone. I'd love to connect with fellow participants and learn from their experiences, too. Let's crush some datasets and have some fun along the way! Hey there! I'm Léa, a 21-year-old student with a passion for technology and creativity. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to combine code and art. When I'm not studying, you can find me jamming to music or doodling designs. I've got a few months of coding experience under my belt and I'm excited to level up my skills at this datathon. My goal is to soak up new knowledge, push myself outside my comfort zone, and learn from like-minded folks. Let's get coding and have some fun!
