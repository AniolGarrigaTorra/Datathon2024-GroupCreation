Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to challenge myself and gain more practical experience in programming. I'm a first-year student and still pretty new to coding, so I'm excited to dive into different datasets and tools to learn new skills and techniques. I'm not necessarily gunning for the top prize, but rather focusing on taking away some valuable insights and skills that I can apply to my studies and future projects. Bring it on, I'm ready to learn and level up! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a first-year student with a passion for code. I'm still sharpening my skills, but I'm excited to be part of this datathon. As a beginner in programming, I'm looking forward to diving into different datasets and tools to learn new techniques and gain practical experience. When I'm not coding, you can find me designing graphics or experimenting with AI algorithms. My goal is to take away valuable insights and skills from this challenge to enhance my studies and future projects. Bring on the data, I'm ready to learn and level up!
