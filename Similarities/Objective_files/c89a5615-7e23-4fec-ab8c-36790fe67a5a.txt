I'm all about going for gold! My top priority is to bring home that first-place trophy. I've studied programming for three years and have a taste of competition from my one hackathon experience. I'm ready to put my skills to the test and strategize my way to the top. I'll be pouring all my energy into building the most innovative and efficient solutions, networking with the best, and capitalizing on every opportunity to gain an edge. Don't expect me to socialize too much - my sights are set on the leaderboard! Hey there! I'm Anna-Marie, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast with a burning desire to be the best. With three years of programming under my belt, I'm itching to showcase my skills in this datathon. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm excited to see how I can apply my knowledge to create something innovative. When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming or designing in Figma. I'm all about pushing myself to new heights and seeing what I'm capable of. Expect me to be focused and driven during the datathon!
