For me, the datathon is a unique opportunity to level up my skills and dive deeper into the world of data analysis and programming. My objective is to take what I've learned so far and push myself to master new concepts and techniques. I'm excited to work on real-world projects, learn from industry experts, and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions. I'm not necessarily looking to win, but rather to walk away with a newfound sense of confidence and a solid foundation for my future studies and career. Hi, I'm Ariadna! I'm a first-year student with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to take my beginner-level programming skills to the next level. I'm fascinated by the world of data analysis and eager to learn from industry experts and work on real-world projects. Outside of class, you can find me tinkering with coding projects, gaming, or reading up on the latest tech trends. I'm looking forward to this challenge and the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for tech.
