I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I've done a few hackathons before, but I'm always looking to level up my game. I'm excited to work with new people, try out new tools, and tackle different challenges. I'm hoping to come away from this datathon with a better understanding of how to apply machine learning to real-world problems, and maybe even build some practical skills I can use in my studies or future projects. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Emilia Rose Harris, a third-year student looking to take my learning to the next level at this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm usually tinkering with code or exploring the latest tech trends. I've had some fun hacking around with data before, but I'm always eager to dive deeper and discover new ways to crunch numbers. I'm excited to meet fellow enthusiasts, share some laughs, and maybe even stumble upon a hidden gem that sparks my passion. Bring on the challenges - I'm ready to geek out and make some progress!
