For me, this datathon is all about leveling up my skills and expanding my knowledge. I'm looking to take away new techniques, approaches, and perspectives to enhance my programming abilities. I'm eager to learn from my peers and mentors, and I'm hoping to push myself outside of my comfort zone. By the end of this datathon, I aim to have tackled challenging projects, received feedback, and walked away with practical takeaways that I can apply to my future projects and studies. Hey there! I'm Emily, a 20-year-old student in my second year of studying programming. I'm thrilled to be a part of this datathon, where I hope to take my skills to the next level and discover new approaches to coding. I've been interested in tech since forever and have dabbled in a few programming languages. Outside of coding, I'm a music enthusiast and enjoy doodling. I'm looking forward to collaborating with fellow participants, learning from mentors, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. Let's have some fun and make some innovative tech magic!
