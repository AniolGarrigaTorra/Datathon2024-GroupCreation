I'm Lluisa and my objective for this datathon is simple: I want to crush it! I'm all about competition, so I'm in it to win it. I'm not looking to just go through the motions, I'm ready to put in the hard work and see my ideas come to life. I've got a strong background in programming and I'm confident in my abilities, so I'm aiming for the top spot. Bring it on, I'm ready to take on the challenges and outshine the competition! Hey there! I'm Lluisa, a 21-year-old third-year student, and a coding enthusiast. When I'm not sipping coffee or binge-watching my favorite shows, you can find me tinkering with code, trying to outsmart cybersecurity breaches or designing sleek UIs. I've had my hands dirty with coding languages like C++ and React, and I'm hooked on the rush of solving puzzles. I'm all about competitiveness and strive for perfection. I'm here to win and make it an unforgettable experience. Wish me luck, and let's crush this datathon together!
