My objective for this datathon is to have an absolute blast with my fellow participants! I'm all about creating unforgettable memories, making new friends, and having a whale of a time. While I'm excited to dabble in some new tech, I'm not going for the gold. I just want to soak up the datathon vibes, take part in as many events as possible, and enjoy the ride. I'm Emily, by the way! Nice to meet you, and let's make some datathon magic together! Hey there! I'm Emily, a fourth-year student with a passion for exploring the latest tech trends. I've dabbled in a bit of everything, from building cool user experiences to experimenting with augmented reality. I'm all about creating something new and innovative, whether it's a game-changing e-commerce platform or a fintech solution. But honestly, I'm just here to have an absolute blast with my fellow participants! I'm all about making unforgettable memories, taking part in rad events, and enjoying the ride. Let's make some datathon magic happen!
