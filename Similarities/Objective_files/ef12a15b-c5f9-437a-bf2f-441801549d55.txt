I'm super excited to be here! For this datathon, I'm all about having a blast and meeting like-minded people. My goal is to soak up the atmosphere, learn new skills, and, of course, make new friends! I'm not really competition-focused; I'd rather hang out at the cafe, attend all the workshop sessions, and participate in random events just to see what's going on. I want to absorb the datathon vibe and get the most out of this experience. Wish me luck, and let's have some fun! Hey there! I'm Emilia Joy, a 20-year-old student in my third year. I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! When I'm not studying, you can find me geeking out over new technologies, designing UI/UX wonders, or devouring the latest gaming updates. I'm all about making an impact through technology and am excited to meet like-minded folks who share my passion for social good. I'm looking forward to soaking up the datathon atmosphere, learning from the best, and making friends along the way!
