As a total newbie to datathons, I'm super excited to make this a fun and memorable experience! My goal is to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and make some amazing friends. I want to dive into as many events as possible, learn from others, and soak up all the inspiration and energy in the room. Of course, I'm also eager to have fun and enjoy the experience - who knows, maybe even discover some hidden talents I didn't know I had! Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a 19-year-old undergraduate with a passion for tech and learning. I've dabbled in coding a bit, mostly on my own, and I'm excited to see what this datathon has in store. I'm a curious individual who loves discovering new things and meeting like-minded people. My interests range from exploring how technology can make our lives easier to enjoying games and staying up-to-date with the latest fintech innovations. I'm looking forward to making friends, learning from others, and having a blast - who knows what this weekend will bring!
