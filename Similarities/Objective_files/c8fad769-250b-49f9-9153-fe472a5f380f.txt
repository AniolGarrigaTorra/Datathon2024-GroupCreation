Hey! I'm Emilia Ryder, and my objective for this datathon is to make the most of my first datathon experience. I'm really looking forward to meeting new people, having fun, and getting involved in all the cool events that come with it. I'd love to learn new things and improve my skills, but I'm not as concerned about the competition as I am about making friends and memories. I'm all about creating an unforgettable experience, attending cool workshops, and maybe even discovering some new hidden talents! Bring on the datathon adventure! Hey there! I'm Emilia, a 19-year-old student with a passion for making things happen. I'm a newbie to programming, but I've been hooked since I discovered the world of DevOps. I'm all about innovative tech and loving the thrill of discovery. When I'm not tinkering with code, I'm fascinated by AR/VR and its potential to transform education. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, where I can unleash my creativity, learn from awesome folks, and create unforgettable memories!
