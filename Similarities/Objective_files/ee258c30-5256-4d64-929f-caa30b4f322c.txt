Hey! I'm Lena, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to soak up the vibes and have an amazing time with fellow enthusiasts. I want to meet new people, learn from their experiences, and build new friendships. I'm not too concerned about winning or impressing anyone - I just want to participate in as many events as possible, have fun, and take part in all the fun activities they're offering. Expect to find me running around, trying new things, and enjoying the datathon atmosphere with a big smile on my face! Hey there! I'm Lena, a 22-year-old student with a passion for building cool things. I'm always up for a challenge and love experimenting with new technologies.
