Hi! My objective for this datathon is super chill - I just want to have a blast and make some awesome new friends. I'm all about vibing with like-minded people and seeing what creative projects we can come up with together. I'm not worried about winning or putting in overtime; I'm here to hang loose, enjoy the atmosphere, and participate in as many events as possible (except maybe the ones that require too much coding - ugh!). If we happen to create something awesome, that's just the cherry on top! Hey there! I'm Llu√Øsa, a 19-year-old student with a passion for making cool stuff. When I'm not hitting the books, I love designing and building things, whether it's a digital mockup or a web app. I'm all about creativity, learning, and sharing ideas with others. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends and finding innovative ways to use them. I'm super stoked to be at this datathon and can't wait to connect with fellow enthusiasts like myself. Let's create something amazing together and have a blast while doing it!
