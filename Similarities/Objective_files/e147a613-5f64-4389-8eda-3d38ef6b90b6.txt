Hey, my objective for this datathon is all about embracing the experience and having a blast! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, forming connections, and making unforgettable memories. I'm not too fussed about winning - I'd love to participate in as many events as possible, from workshops to mentor sessions. I'm excited to explore new technologies, learn from others, and soak up as much knowledge as I can. Most importantly, I want to leave with a solid network of friends who share similar interests and passions. Hey everyone! I'm Lorenzo, a third-year student with a passion for programming and cybersecurity. When I'm not studying, you can find me exploring new lifehacks or jamming out to some tunes. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon and can't wait to meet new faces! I'm all about embracing the experience, learning from others, and having a blast. Let's crush this and make some unforgettable memories, guys! I'm looking forward to diving into workshops, mentor sessions, and soaking up as much knowledge as possible. See you around!
