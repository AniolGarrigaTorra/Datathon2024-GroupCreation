For me, this datathon is all about connection and experience. I'm not here to stress about winning or making a million bucks - I just want to make some cool people, learn from them, and have a blast! I love coding, don't get me wrong, but it's the moments in between, the talks, the workshops, and the after-parties that make events like this so worth it. I'm stoked to participate in as many events as I can, swap stories with fellow participants, and maybe even stumble upon a new passion or interest. Let's do this and have some fun! Hey there! I'm Ava Brown, a third-year student with a passion for technology and creativity. I've been exploring the world of coding for a while now, and I'm super excited to meet fellow coding enthusiasts like you at the datathon. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest music trends or experimenting with art. I'm all about learning from others and having fun, and I'm stoked to be a part of this event! I'm looking forward to making new friends, exchanging stories, and maybe discovering some new passions along the way.
