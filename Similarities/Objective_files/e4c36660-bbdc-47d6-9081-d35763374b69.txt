My goal for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I've had a bit of experience with programming, but I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and step out of my comfort zone. I want to challenge myself to try new things, ask questions, and soak up as much information as possible. I'm excited to work with other participants and mentors to build new skills and projects, and to see what I can accomplish over the course of the weekend. I'm not super competitive, so I'm happy to focus on my own growth and learning! Hey there! I'm Katarina, a fourth-year student with a passion for making an impact. I've dabbled in coding and design, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of datathon. I'm all about learning new skills, meeting like-minded folks, and tackling challenging projects. My aim is to step out of my comfort zone, ask lots of questions, and soak up as much as possible. I'm a curious and creative person who loves exploring cutting-edge tech, especially in areas like quantum and blockchain. Can't wait to collaborate with fellow datathoners and learn together over the weekend!
