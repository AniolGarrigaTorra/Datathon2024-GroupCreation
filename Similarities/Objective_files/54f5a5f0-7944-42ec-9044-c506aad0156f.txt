Hey! My objective for this datathon is all about having a blast and soaking up the atmosphere. I'm looking to make some new friends and connections within the community, and I'm all about having fun while learning and participating in various events. I'm not necessarily looking to win at all costs, but rather enjoying the experience and getting the most out of it. I'm hoping to make memories, try new things, and come away from this with a stronger sense of camaraderie and enthusiasm for data and tech. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Amarilis, a 20-year-old student eager to dive into the world of data and technology. I'm all about experimenting with new ideas and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. When I'm not busy with studies, you can find me exploring the intersection of tech and social good. I'm excited to meet fellow enthusiasts and take part in this datathon, not just to learn new skills, but to build connections and make memories. Let's grab this opportunity and make the most of it! I'm ready to be challenged, inspired, and inspired!
