Hi! I'm Maria Elena. My main goal for this datathon is to have an amazing time with fellow data enthusiasts! I want to make new friends who share my passions, learn about new tools and techniques, and just have a blast. I'm not too fussed about winning (although, who knows, it could be a bonus). For me, it's all about the experiences, the connections, and the memories. I'm looking forward to participating in all the events, workshops, and activities, and just enjoying the ride! Let's get this datathon started and have some fun! Hey everyone! I'm Maria Elena, a 19-year-old student in my first year of university. I'm super stoked to be a part of this datathon and meet like-minded individuals who share my passion for data! I've always been drawn to the intersection of tech and communication, and I'm excited to learn from and connect with you all. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me vibing out to music, trying out new art styles, or geeking out over the latest AI innovations. Let's get this party started and make some amazing memories!
