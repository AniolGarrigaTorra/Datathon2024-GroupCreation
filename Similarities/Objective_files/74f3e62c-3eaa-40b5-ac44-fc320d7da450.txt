My objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and improve my programming skills. I've already had some experience with hackathons, but I know there's always more to learn and I'm excited to dive deeper into new technologies and topics. I'm looking forward to picking the brains of other participants, hearing their experiences, and maybe even discovering some new areas of interest. I want to leave this event feeling challenged, inspired, and equipped with new knowledge and skills to take back to my own projects and further my education. Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a third-year student diving into the world of tech. I've had a blast participating in hackathons, and I'm all about leveraging tech for social good. My curiosity often gets the better of me, and I find myself exploring voice skills, gaming, and databases. I'm a big fan of creative outlets, too - music, art, and design are all close to my heart. I'm thrilled to be here, hoping to pick up new skills, learn from others, and be inspired to take on new challenges. Can't wait to see what this datathon brings!
