I'm looking forward to sharing laughs, exchanging stories, and maybe even stumbling upon a new favorite language or tool! Can't wait to see what this datathon brings! Hey, I'm Alicia! I'm a third-year student studying programming, with a passion for cybersecurity and the ever-evolving world of blockchain. I'm an eager beaver, always up for a challenge and a good dose of curiosity.
