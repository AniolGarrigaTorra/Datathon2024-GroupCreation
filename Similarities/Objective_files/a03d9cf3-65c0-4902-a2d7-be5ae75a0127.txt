My objective for this datathon is to take my skills to the next level! As a third-year student, I'm eager to learn new techniques, tools, and technologies. I'm hoping to get my hands dirty on some real-world problems and challenge myself to tackle complexity. I want to soak up as much knowledge as possible, refine my coding muscles, and maybe even discover a new area of interest. For me, datathons are an awesome opportunity to level up and stay ahead of the game. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Sophie, a third-year student with a passion for tech and a thirst for adventure. I've always been drawn to the world of programming, where every problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved. I'm an advocate for social good and love how data can be used to drive positive change. In my free time, you can catch me jamming to my favorite tunes or sketching out new design ideas. I'm super excited to dive into the datathon and push myself to tackle new challenges - I'm ready to level up and make some unforgettable memories!
