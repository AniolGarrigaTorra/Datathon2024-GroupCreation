Hey, I'm Astrid! My objective for this datathon is to absorb as much as I can and level up my skills. I'm really excited to dive into new technologies and approaches, and I hope to get hands-on experience working with cool datasets. I'm hoping to get out of this event with a fresh perspective, new tool belt, and a portfolio of skills to show off on my resume. Bring on the challenges and learning opportunities - I'm ready to crush them and come out a better developer on the other side! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a 19-year-old undergrad student passionate about creating positive change through technology. With a growing interest in data and its potential for social impact, I'm thrilled to be participating in this datathon. I'm a curious and dedicated individual, always eager to dive into new challenges and absorb as much as I can. My ultimate goal is to leave this event with a newfound sense of confidence, a fresh portfolio of skills, and a network of like-minded individuals. Let's make some impact together!
