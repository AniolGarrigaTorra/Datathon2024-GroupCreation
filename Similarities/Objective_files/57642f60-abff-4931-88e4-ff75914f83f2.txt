As a second-year student, I'm eager to put my programming skills to the test in this datathon. My goal is to take this opportunity to learn as much as I can, expand my knowledge, and improve my programming skills. I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges, working with others, and picking up tips and tricks from the more experienced participants. I want to leave this datathon with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that I've leveled up my skills and gained valuable experience to carry forward into my studies and future projects. Bring it on!
