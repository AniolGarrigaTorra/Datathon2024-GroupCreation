My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm all about winning. I'm a competitor at heart, and I thrive under pressure. I'm looking to challenge myself, push my skills to the limit, and see where I stack up against the best. I'm not here to make friends or have a good time (at least, not primarily - I'm sure I'll enjoy myself too!). My goal is to outsmart, outwork, and out-code the competition, and take home the top prize. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Luna, a fiery 20-year-old student with a passion for coding and a thirst for victory. As a competitive programmer, I thrive in high-pressure situations, which makes this datathon the perfect playground for me. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push my skills to the limit. My experience with databases and a dash of creativity fuel my problem-solving skills. When I'm not debugging code, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes or admiring street art. My goal is clear: I'm here to win, and I won't stop until I achieve it.
