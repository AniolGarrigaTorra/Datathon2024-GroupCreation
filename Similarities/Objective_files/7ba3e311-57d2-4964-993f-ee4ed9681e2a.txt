For this datathon, I'm not about winning or competition. As a newbie in the programming world, I'm really looking to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I've had limited experience with coding, and I'm eager to dive deeper and learn from others. I'd love to get hands-on experience with new tools and technologies, and learn how to tackle real-world problems. My goal is to take away new knowledge and skills that I can apply to my studies and future projects, so I can become a better programmer and data analyst. Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 17-year-old student eager to dive into the world of coding. I'm a newbie in programming, but I'm all about learning and improving my skills. I've always been fascinated by how code can change the world, and I'm excited to collaborate with others who share my passion. For me, this datathon is an opportunity to grow, learn new tools, and tackle real-world problems. I'm looking forward to networking with others, sharing my ideas, and taking away knowledge and skills that I can apply to my studies and future projects.
