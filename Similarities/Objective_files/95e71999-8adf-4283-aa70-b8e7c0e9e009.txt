My goal is to immerse myself in the datathon experience, beyond just the coding challenges! I want to meet new people and make friends who share similar interests. I'm all about vibing with others who are passionate about tech and learning. I'm excited to participate in as many events and activities as possible, whether it's workshops, presentations, or even just grabbing coffee with fellow participants. I'm looking forward to having an epic time and taking away unforgettable memories. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Katja, and I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! I'm a 17-year-old student with a passion for all things tech and learning. I'm really interested in creating immersive experiences, whether that's through AR/VR or building amazing websites. When I'm not programming, you can find me doodling or browsing design blogs for inspiration. I'm a people person, and I'm really looking forward to meeting other tech enthusiasts and learning from their experiences. I'm all about having fun and taking risks, so let's make some unforgettable memories together!
