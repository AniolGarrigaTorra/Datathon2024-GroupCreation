I'm all about leveling up my skills at this datathon! As a second-year student, I'm eager to dive deeper into new technologies and techniques. My goal is to tackle challenges and projects that push my comfort zone and help me improve my coding skills. I'm not too concerned about winning first prize, but rather want to absorb as much as I can from the experience. I hope to learn from fellow participants, snag some new ideas, and walk away from this event with a fresh set of skills to add to my belt. Hey there! I'm Lena Schmidt, a curious and adventurous 19-year-old student looking to level up my coding skills at this datathon. I'm all about exploring new technologies and diving headfirst into challenging projects. My academic background has given me a solid foundation in programming, and I'm excited to apply my knowledge to real-world problems. I'm passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact and am drawn to challenges that push my creative problem-solving skills. I'm all about collaboration, community, and personal growth - and I can't wait to learn from and be inspired by fellow participants!
