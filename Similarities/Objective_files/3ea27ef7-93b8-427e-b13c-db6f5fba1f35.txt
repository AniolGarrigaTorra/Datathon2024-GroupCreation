Hi! I'm Maya. For this datathon, I'm really excited to dive into learning new tools and techniques, and to improve my skills in programming. My goal is to come out of this event feeling more confident in my abilities and having gained new knowledge that I can apply to my future projects. I'm looking forward to tackling challenging problems, getting feedback from others, and learning from their experiences. I hope to walk away with a fresh perspective, new skills, and a sense of accomplishment. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Maya, a 20-year-old student passionate about building innovative solutions. With an intermediate level of programming experience, I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art, which is why I'm excited to be here at the datathon. I'm all about learning from others, taking on new challenges, and growing as a programmer. Let's connect and see where this event takes us!
