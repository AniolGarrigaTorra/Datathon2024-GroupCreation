I'm Evelyn, and I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to have an amazing time, make new friends, and be a part of as many events as possible. I'm all about soaking up the datathon vibes, learning from others, and laughing together over some crazy coding moments. I'm not really about competition or stress - I'm all about the fun, the excitement, and the adventure! Let's grab coffee, swap war stories, and get this datathon started! Hey there! I'm Evelyn, a third-year student with a passion for blending tech and creativity. I'm all about innovation, whether it's through building a lifehacking app or designing a slick user interface.
