Honestly, I'm all about winning. I've been to four hackathons before and I've never taken home the top prize. It's my goal to change that. I'm here to give it my all, put in the long hours, and crush the competition. I want to be the one walking away with the top prize, not just participating for the sake of participating. Bring it on, I'm ready to go all out and prove myself! Hey there! I'm Mariona Everett, a 20-year-old third-year student, fueled by a passion for making a difference through technology. I've always been fascinated by how code can be used to create impact, and I've had a taste of it through my experiences in hackathons. When I'm not buried in books or scripts, you can find me gaming with friends or exploring the latest developments in blockchain and cryptocurrency. I'm all about putting my knowledge into action, and this datathon is my chance to showcase my skills and push myself to the limit. Let's crush this!
