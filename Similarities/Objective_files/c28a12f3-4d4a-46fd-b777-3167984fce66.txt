Hey there! As a third-year computer science student, I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of data and machine learning. My objective for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge and skill as possible. I want to challenge myself by tackling new technologies and approaches, and learn from others in the community. I'm not too competitive about winning, and would much rather focus on improving my own understanding and abilities. By the end of this datathon, I hope to walk away with a few new tricks up my sleeve and a fresh perspective on my studies. Hey, I'm Aur√®lia! A third-year computer science student with a passion for tech and learning. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, ready to absorb new knowledge and skills. Outside of academics, I enjoy gaming and trying to stay productive while surrounded by the hustle and bustle of campus life. I'm a creative problem-solver at heart, and I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges and learning from others in the community. I'm more interested in personal growth than competitive wins, so let's geek out and see what we can accomplish together!
