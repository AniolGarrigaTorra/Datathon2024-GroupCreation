My objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into new tools, technologies, and approaches. I'm looking to take my programming skills to the next level and gain valuable experience in working with massive datasets. I'm all about learning and improving, so I'd love to collaborate with others, absorb knowledge, and experiment with new ideas. I'm not too hung up on winning - I'm here to challenge myself and come away with new skills and perspectives. Bring on the complexity and the challenges - I'm ready to geek out and level up my game! Hey, I'm Ava! I'm a 3rd-year student with a passion for diving headfirst into new tech. I'm a problem-solver at heart and love finding innovative solutions to complex challenges. In my free time, you can catch me geeking out over the latest advancements in quantum computing and robotics. I'm excited to be here at the datathon to level up my programming skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I'm all about learning, improving, and exploring new ideas - and I'm looking forward to the thrilling ride ahead!
