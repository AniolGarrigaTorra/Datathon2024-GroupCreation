I'm all about the win, folks! As a young programmer with limited experience, I'm here to learn and improve, but my primary objective is to compete and try to win. I've participated in one hackathon before, and it was an incredible rush! I'm excited to test my skills and push myself to the limit. I'm looking to work with a team to create an innovative and impactful project that will wow the judges and give me that sweet, sweet first prize! I'm ready to put in the long hours, hustle, and grind to take home the win. Hey, I'm Aleixandra! I'm a 17-year-old university student eager to unleash my creativity and passion for coding. As a beginner programmer, I'm excited to tackle new challenges and level up my skills. I'm all about innovation, and I believe technology has the power to make a positive impact on society. I've got a bit of a competitive streak, and I'm here to learn and grow while striving to take home the top prize. I'm ready to dive in, work hard, and create something incredible with my new teammates!
