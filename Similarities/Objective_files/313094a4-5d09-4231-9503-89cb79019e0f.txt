Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to gain as much knowledge and skills as possible. As a 4th-year student with limited experience, I'm eager to learn from experts and industry professionals. I'm looking to improve my programming skills, specifically in data analysis and visualization. I want to explore new tools and techniques, and be able to apply what I learn to real-world problems. For me, the datathon is about stepping out of my comfort zone and growing as a developer, not about the competition. I'm excited to absorb as much as I can and come out a better programmer at the end! Hey! I'm Lucas, a 22-year-old student with a passion for tech and learning. I'm heading into my final year of university, and I'm excited to take my programming skills to the next level at this datathon. I've had a taste of programming and data analysis, but I know there's so much more to explore. I'm all about continuous learning and stepping out of my comfort zone. For me, this datathon is an opportunity to gain new knowledge, improve my skills, and network with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for tech.
