I'm all about competition! My objective for this datathon is to give it my all and win, plain and simple. I'm fueled by the thrill of competition and the desire to prove myself. I'm a beginner in the world of data analytics, but I've done my fair share of hackathons and learned from them. I'm ready to take on new challenges, crush problems, and demonstrate my skills to the world. My ultimate goal is to bring home the trophy and get recognition for my hard work. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Luz Mar√≠a Delgado, and I'm thrilled to be a part of this datathon. As a 20-year-old student, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I've had a taste of hackathons before, and I'm hooked on the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of pushing myself to learn and innovate. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me gaming or exploring the latest fintech trends. I'm excited to dive into the world of data analytics and make a mark here. Let's get ready to take on the datathon and have some fun!
