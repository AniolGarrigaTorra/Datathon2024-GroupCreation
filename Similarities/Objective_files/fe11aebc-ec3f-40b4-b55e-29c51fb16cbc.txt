My objective for this datathon is straightforward - I'm here to win. With six hackathons under my belt, I've honed my skills in programming and I'm looking to put them to the test. I'll be dedicating all my energy to creating a stellar project that blows the judges away. No distractions, no side hustles - my sole focus is on taking home that top prize. I'm all about strategy, speed, and staying ahead of the curve. Watch out, competitors, Aurora Lane is on the prowl and ready to take on the challenge! Hi there! I'm Aurora Lane, a third-year student with a passion for coding and innovation. I've been to six hackathons before, and I'm no stranger to the thrill of pushing boundaries and solving problems fast. My focus is on creating solutions that make a real impact, whether it's through AR/VR or social good. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to music or sketching out art. I thrive on the energy of hackathons and live by the motto: 'Strive to be the best.' Get ready for a fierce competition!
