I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! For me, it's all about leveling up my skills. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I feel like I've plateaued a bit. I'm looking forward to diving into new technologies and methodologies to improve my programming chops. I want to learn how to effectively integrate machine learning with data visualization, and explore some new data manipulation techniques. Most importantly, I want to make sense of it all and build a cool project to showcase my new skills! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 20-year-old junior studying computer science. I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon, where I can elevate my skills and challenge myself to learn something new. Having experience in hackathons, I feel like I've hit a plateau, and this is the perfect opportunity to refresh and upgrade my skills. I'm passionate about using technology for good and have a background in e-commerce, which has given me a knack for problem-solving. I'm excited to dive into machine learning, data visualization, and explore new technologies - it's going to be an amazing experience!
