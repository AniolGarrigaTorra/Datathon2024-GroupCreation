I'll be digging deep, pouring all my skills and experience into solving the challenges. I want to push my limits and see what I'm capable of. I'm prepared to work tirelessly, testing boundaries and thinking outside the box. Bring on the toughest problems, and I'll make sure I solve them faster and better than anyone else. It's game on, and I'm ready to crush it! Hey there! I'm Anaïs Pérez-Roca, a 21-year-old computer science student on a mission to win this datathon. I've got a strong background in programming and have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and problem-solving. I thrive in fast-paced environments and love brainstorming innovative solutions. My competitive streak's in overdrive, and I'm ready to pour my heart and soul into cracking these challenges. Expect a lot of hard work, creativity, and determination - and maybe a few out-of-the-box ideas!
