Hey, I'm Zarina! My objective for this datathon is clear-cut: I'm here to compete and take the top spot. I've participated in 5 hackathons before, and I'm not satisfied with anything less than winning. I'll be putting in the extra hours, pouring over code and scouring data sets to create something innovative and impactful. I'm looking forward to testing my skills against others and pushing myself to be the best I can be. Bring on the challenges and let's see if I can come out on top! Hey there! I'm Zarina, a 19-year-old student on a mission to make it to the top. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me trying to level up in my favorite games or exploring the world of e-commerce. Programming is my thing, and I've been honing my skills through hackathons and personal projects. My goal is to win this datathon and prove to myself that I've got what it takes to be a top player. I'm competitive, driven, and always up for a challenge. Get ready for a fierce competitor!
