My main objective for this datathon is to learn new things and improve my skills in programming and data analysis. I'm excited to be surrounded by other coding enthusiasts and experts who can share their knowledge and experiences with me. I'd like to take this opportunity to dive deeper into new technologies, refine my problem-solving strategies, and learn from feedback and critiques. I'm looking forward to expanding my skillset and building a strong foundation for future projects and opportunities. Hey there! I'm Maria Claudia Kaiser, a 20-year-old third-year student looking to take my coding skills to the next level. I'm a curious and eager learner with a passion for innovation and creative problem-solving. I'm excited to dive into the world of datathon, where I can learn from others, share my own knowledge, and push my limits as a programmer. I'm always looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve and expand my skills, especially in areas like augmented reality and designing user-friendly interfaces. Can't wait to get started and see what this datathon has in store!
