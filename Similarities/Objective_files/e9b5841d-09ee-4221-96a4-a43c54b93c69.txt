Hi! I'm Celia Pereira Silva, and I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My objective is to come out with new knowledge and improved skills. I'm hoping to dive deeper into advanced topics, learn from fellow participants, and maybe even take on some challenging projects. I'm not really interested in the competition side of things, so I won't be sweating the judges' scores. I just want to make the most of this opportunity and come away with a sense of accomplishment, a fresh new skillset, and maybe even a cool project to add to my portfolio! Hey there! I'm Celia Pereira Silva, a 21-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems. I've been writing code for a few years now, and I'm eager to dive deeper into new technologies and learn from my fellow participants at the datathon. I'm particularly interested in exploring how technology can be used for social good, and I love learning about emerging trends like artificial intelligence and natural language processing. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming with my guitar or playing the latest video games.
