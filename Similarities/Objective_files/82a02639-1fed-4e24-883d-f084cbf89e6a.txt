Hey! So, I'm super stoked to be at this datathon! My main goal is to learn as much as I can and take my skills to the next level. I want to get hands-on experience with new tech and datasets, and challenge myself to think creatively. I'm not really focused on winning, but more about what I can take away from this event. I'm all about growth and self-improvement, so I'm looking forward to collaborating with fellow participants, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and leveling up my game! Hey there! I'm Ava Waters, a third-year student on a mission to take my coding skills to the next level. I'm super excited to be here and learn from others while sharing my own experiences. I'm all about collaboration, creative problem-solving, and self-improvement. I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact, and I'm hoping to learn more about the latest innovations and trends. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new projects or exploring the world of art and design. Let's chat and see what we can create together!
