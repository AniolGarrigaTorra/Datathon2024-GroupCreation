My goal for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and take away new skills and knowledge. I'm still early in my degree, so I'm really focused on improving my programming abilities and expanding my toolkit. I'm hoping to gain some insight from industry experts and learn from others participating in the events. I'd also love to pick up some practical tips and tricks to apply to my projects and enhance my problem-solving skills. Overall, I'm excited to challenge myself, stay engaged, and come away with something valuable to take back to my studies. Hi everyone!
