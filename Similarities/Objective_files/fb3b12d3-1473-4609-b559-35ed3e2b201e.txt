For me, this datathon is all about growth. I'm looking forward to stepping out of my comfort zone and expanding my programming skills. I'm an intermediate coder, so I'm hoping to dive into new languages and tools to take my skills to the next level. I'm not too competitive when it comes to winning, I'm more excited about learning from others and figuring out new ways to solve problems. By the end of this datathon, I want to have a solid understanding of machine learning and data analysis, and be inspired to continue pushing myself to improve my skills. Hey! I'm SÃ­lvia, a second-year student with a passion for tech and innovation. I've been coding for a while now, and I'm always looking for new challenges to level up my skills. For this datathon, I'm excited to push my limits and learn from others. I'm a creative problem-solver, and I'm all about making things more efficient and organized. Whether it's finding new ways to hack into productivity or exploring the world of machine learning, I'm always up for a good problem to solve. Let's see what we can create together!
