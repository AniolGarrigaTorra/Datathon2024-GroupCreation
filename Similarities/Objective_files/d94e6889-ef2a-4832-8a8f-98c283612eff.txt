Hey there! I'm Ariel, and I'm all about growing as a developer. My objective for this datathon is to make the most of it from a learning perspective. I'm still relatively new to coding, and I know that's where I'm gonna learn the most from other participants and experienced mentors. I want to improve my skills, get a chance to work on different projects, and get exposure to various tools and tech stacks. If I can take away some valuable insights and knowledge by the end of this datathon, I'll consider it a success! Hey there! I'm Ariel, an 18-year-old student eager to grow as a developer.
