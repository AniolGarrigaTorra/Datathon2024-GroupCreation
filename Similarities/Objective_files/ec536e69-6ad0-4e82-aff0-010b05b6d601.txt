Hey! As Coralina, my goal for this datathon is to bring my A-game and emerge victorious. I'm fueled by my competitive nature and passionate about learning and improvement. I've participated in two hackathons before, and I'm looking to take it to the next level. I'll be focusing on perfecting my coding skills, staying ahead of the curve with the latest trends, and strategizing with my team to deliver a winning project. I want to test my limits, push myself to the extreme, and prove to myself that I've got what it takes to be a top performer in this datathon. Hey there!
