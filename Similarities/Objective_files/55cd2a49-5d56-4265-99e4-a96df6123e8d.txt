Hey there! As Lena Marie Fischer, my objective for this datathon is all about personal growth and skill improvement. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into data-related topics, exploring new technologies, and tackling real-world problems alongside fellow participants. I want to come away from this event with a better understanding of the latest tools and techniques, and to be able to apply my newfound knowledge to my own projects. Of course, making new friends and having fun along the way is a definite bonus! Hi, I'm Lena! A 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and exploring the world of data.
