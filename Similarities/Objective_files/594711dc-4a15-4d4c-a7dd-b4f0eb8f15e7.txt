My objective for this datathon? To come out on top! I'm all about giving it my best shot and going for that win. I've got a fire in my belly to prove myself and take home the trophy. I'm not looking to make friends (not that I don't want to, but priorities!) or coast through the events. I'm in it to crush the challenges and show off my skills. I'll be pouring my heart and soul into this competition, so watch out - I'm coming for you! Hey there, I'm Giulia Serena Weston. I'm a 1st-year student with a fire in my belly and a passion for making an impact. I'm all about efficiency and getting things done, so you can count on me to be sharp-witted and quick on my feet. I'm driven by a desire to prove myself and make a name for myself. You won't catch me coasting through challenges - I'm in it to win it! I'm looking forward to unleashing my competitive spirit and giving it my all at this datathon. Let's see what I'm made of!
