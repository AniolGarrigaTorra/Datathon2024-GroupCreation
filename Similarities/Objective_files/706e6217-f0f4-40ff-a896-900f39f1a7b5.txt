I'm in it to win it! My objective is to give it my all and try to take home that top prize. I've got a solid foundation in programming, and I'm ready to show off my skills. I've competed in two hackathons before, so I know what it takes to deliver a solid solution on a tight deadline. I'm not here to make friends (although, I'm sure that'll happen along the way), I'm here to crush the competition and bring home the win. Bring it on, let's see what I'm capable of! Hey there! I'm Enric Valleson, a 19-year-old computer science student. I'm all about innovating and pushing boundaries, whether it's building futuristic experiences or streamlining processes. My hackathon experience has taught me the value of working under pressure and bringing crazy ideas to life. This datathon is my chance to prove myself and demonstrate my skills. I'm confident, driven, and always up for a challenge. Get ready for some serious creativity and productivity. Let's see what we can accomplish together - and maybe, just maybe, take home that top prize!
