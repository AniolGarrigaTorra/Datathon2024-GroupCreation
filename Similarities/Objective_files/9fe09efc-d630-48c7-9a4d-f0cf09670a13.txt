I'm stoked to be at this datathon! My goal is to come away with some awesome new skills and knowledge to take back to my university degree. I've just started learning to code, and I'd love to gain more confidence and experience with real-world projects. I'm all about absorbing as much as I can from the workshops and mentorship sessions, and I'm excited to collaborate with other participants to build something innovative. My primary focus is on leveling up my skills, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! Hey there! I'm Ava Wynter, and I'm thrilled to be here at the datathon! As a fresh-faced student, I'm just starting to dip my toes into the world of programming. Despite being a newbie, I'm super excited to learn as much as I can and take it to the next level. I'm really drawn to the tech side of things, especially stuff like AR/VR and Voice skills - it's like the ultimate intersection of art and tech! With this event, I'm hoping to level up my skills, absorb as much as possible, and collaborate with awesome people like you!
