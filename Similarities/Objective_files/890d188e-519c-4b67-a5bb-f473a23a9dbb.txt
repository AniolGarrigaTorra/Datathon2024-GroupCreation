Hey! As a 19-year-old computer science student, I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon. For me, the main goal is to soak up new knowledge and skills. I want to challenge myself by working on new projects and algorithms, and learning from other datathon participants. I'm looking to improve my programming skills, especially in data visualization and machine learning. I'm open to collaborating with others, but ultimately, my focus is on personal growth and stepping out of my comfort zone. Bring on the challenges! Hey, I'm Louna! I'm a second-year computer science student on a mission to level up my programming skills. I'm excited to be here and challenge myself through new projects and collaborations. I'm all about learning and growing, both personally and professionally. With a passion for problem-solving, I'm drawn to projects that make a real impact. I love geeking out over algorithms and data visualization, and I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my skills. I'm a friendly and approachable student, and I'm stoked to meet fellow datathon enthusiasts!
