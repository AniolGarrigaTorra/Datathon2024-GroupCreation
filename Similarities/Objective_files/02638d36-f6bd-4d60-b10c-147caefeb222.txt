Hey! My main objective for this datathon is to level up my skills and learn as much as I can. I'm looking forward to diving into new technologies and methodologies, and I'm eager to get hands-on experience with different tools and approaches. I'm not too concerned about winning - it's not about the prize for me. I just want to take this opportunity to improve my programming skills, stay up-to-date with industry trends, and come out of here feeling more confident in my abilities. Bring on the coding challenges! Hi! I'm Luc√≠a, a 21-year-old third-year student with a passion for coding. I'm excited to be part of this datathon, where I can sharpen my skills and explore new technologies. I'm curious about innovation in various fields, from fintech to education, and I'm always eager to learn. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me building Android apps or playing around with Python. My goal for this datathon is to level up my coding skills and confidence. I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded people and having an epic time while doing it!
