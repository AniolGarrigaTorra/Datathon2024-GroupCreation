My objective for this datathon is to dive deep into new technologies and ideas. With two hackathons under my belt, I've gained a good sense of how to work in a team, but I feel like I've plateaued in terms of skill level. I'm excited to take this opportunity to step out of my comfort zone, try new programming languages and tools, and come away with a newfound confidence in my abilities. I'm all about learning and self-improvement, so I'm looking forward to networking with others who share my passion and expertise. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Arianna, a 21-year-old third-year student with a passion for self-improvement and learning. I've dived into several projects and hackathons, honing my skills in software development. This datathon is a chance for me to stretch my limits, explore new technologies, and tackle challenges from different angles. As an avid design and creativity enthusiast, I'm excited to bring a fresh perspective to our team's project. With my experience in programming and agile methodologies, I'm all about collaboration, experimentation, and growth. I'm looking forward to networking with like-minded individuals and making meaningful connections.
