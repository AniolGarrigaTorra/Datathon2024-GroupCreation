For me, this datathon is an amazing opportunity to dive deeper into machine learning and data analysis. I'm a 3rd-year student looking to gain more experience and improve my skills in these areas. I'm all about expanding my technical know-how, so I'm aiming to take in as much as I can from the workshop sessions and collaborate with fellow participants on projects that challenge me. I'm hoping to walk away from this datathon with new tools, concepts, and problem-solving strategies under my belt, and I'm excited to learn from and with my fellow participants! Hi everyone! I'm Ana, a third-year student looking to level up my tech game. I'm all about problem-solving and learning new tricks. In the tech world, I've got a sweet spot for DevOps and cybersecurity. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to indie music or doodling in my sketchbook. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon and can't wait to dive into machine learning and data analysis with all of you. I'm looking forward to networking, collaborating, and gaining fresh skills and perspectives to rock my future projects!
