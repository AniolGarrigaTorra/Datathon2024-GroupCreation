Hey there! So, I'm really excited to be here at the datathon. For me, it's all about leveling up my skills and learning as much as I can. I've had some experience with programming, but I know there's always more to discover. I'm hoping to take what I learn here and apply it to my studies and maybe even start working on some projects of my own. I'm looking forward to getting hands-on experience with new tools and technologies, and I'm sure I'll pick up some great tips and tricks from the other participants and mentors too! Hey everyone, I'm Sof√≠a! I'm a 2nd-year student with a passion for turning code into something amazing. I've had a basic grasp of programming for a bit now, but I'm eager to dive deeper and make a real impact. When I'm not in class, you can find me experimenting with new tools and languages or catching up on the latest advancements in AI and fintech. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, learning from the best and sharing ideas with fellow enthusiasts. Let's see what the next 48 hours bring!
