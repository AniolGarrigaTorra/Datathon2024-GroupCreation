Hi! My name is Elisabet Fontrodona, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! My goal is to make the most of this awesome experience. I'm looking to make new friends and connections, learn a thing or two (bonus!), and just have an amazing time. I want to participate in as many events as possible, whether it's workshops, tutorials, or competitions - I just want to soak it all up! My idea of a perfect datathon day is one where I learn something new, have a blast with fellow participants, and end the night with new stories to share with friends. Hey there! I'm Elisabet, a 21-year-old student buzzing with enthusiasm for tech and innovation. When I'm not crunching code or exploring new programming languages, you can find me jamming to electronic music or curating art exhibits. My passion lies in bridging the gap between tech and the human experience. I'm pumped to be here at the datathon, where I hope to make unforgettable connections and absorb all the knowledge I can get. Can't wait to share my thoughts, learn from others, and have the time of my life!
