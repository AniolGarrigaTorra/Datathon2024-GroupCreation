Hey! I'm Rebecca, and my objective for this datathon is to level up my skills. I've been programming for a few years, but I know I've still got a lot to learn. I'm excited to tackle new challenges and gain hands-on experience with big data and machine learning. I'm hoping to improve my knowledge in areas like data visualization and natural language processing, and I'm looking forward to learning from others who are just as passionate about tech as I am. My goal is to come away from this event with new skills and a fresh perspective to bring back to my studies. Hi everyone! I'm Rebecca, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I'm an 18-year-old student who's been dabbling in programming for a few years now. I'm looking to level up my skills and explore new areas of tech, particularly big data and machine learning. I'm a creative at heart, and I love combining art and music with technology. I'm also passionate about using tech for social good and improving communication through voice technology. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but I'm always up for a challenge and can't wait to learn from and collaborate with all of you over the next few days.
