I'm all about keeping it chill and making the most of this datathon experience! My goal is to meet fellow participants, swap stories, and learn from each other's experiences. I'd love to join in on as many events and activities as possible, from workshops to social gatherings, and just soak up all the fun and energy. I'm not really looking to push my coding limits or stress about winning - for me, it's about building friendships, discovering new interests, and laughing with fellow datathoners! Bring on the good vibes! Hey everyone! I'm Sophie, a 18-year-old college student here to make the most out of this datathon experience. I'm all about keeping it chill and enjoying the ride. I'm excited to meet fellow participants and learn from their stories. I'm a bit of a creative at heart, and I'm looking forward to discovering new ideas and interests along the way. I'm here for the community vibes, the workshop sessions, and the social gatherings. Bring on the fun and energy - I'm ready to soak it all in!
