My objective for this datathon is to have a blast with fellow coding enthusiasts! I want to soak up the electric atmosphere, make new friends, and be a part of as many events as possible. I'm hoping to learn new tricks and techniques from others, but mainly I just want to have fun and enjoy the experience. I'm all about teamwork and collaboration, so I'm excited to see what we can achieve together. Bring on the coding, coffee, and camaraderie - I'm ready to rock this datathon! Hi there! I'm Ariadna, a 20-year-old student with a passion for programming. I'm currently in my second year, and I'm loving the journey so far. When I'm not stuck in the virtual world of code, I'm exploring my fascination with the intersection of technology and humanity. I believe that tech has the power to revolutionize how we live and interact, and I want to be at the forefront of that revolution. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to connect with like-minded individuals and unleash my creativity. See you there!
