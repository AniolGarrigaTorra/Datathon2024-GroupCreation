My objective for this datathon is to make the most of the experience! I'm really looking forward to meeting new people and making friends. I'm not necessarily trying to win or take things too seriously, but I do want to give back to the community by participating in events and sharing my own skills and knowledge with others. I'm hoping to make lasting connections and memories, and to have a ton of fun while doing it! Hey there! I'm Alexandra, a 21-year-old student with a passion for solving real-world problems through tech. I've been around the block a few times, with intermediate-level programming skills under my belt. I'm really excited to be here at the datathon, not just to win or achieve a specific goal, but to connect with like-minded folks and learn from each other's experiences. On my free time, I love gaming and experimenting with AR/VR ideas. Can't wait to dive in, share my skills, and take away new knowledge! Let's make some magic happen!
