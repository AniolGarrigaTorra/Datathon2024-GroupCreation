I'm all about vibin' with fellow datathoners! For me, this datathon is about making new friends and having an absolute blast. I'm excited to participate in as many events as I can, like workshops, mini-competitions, and even social activities. I want to explore new skills and techniques, but mostly, I want to connect with like-minded people and share laughter and memories. Let's do this! Hey there! I'm Anna Mar√≠a Garcia, an 18-year-old student who's all about exploring the exciting world of tech. I'm a bit of a curious nerd, and I love diving into Fintech and learning about all the ways technology can shape our daily lives. When I'm not glued to my screen, you can find me fangirling over amazing designs or getting excited about the latest quantum breakthroughs. I'm so stoked to be here at the datathon and can't wait to make some incredible memories with all the amazing people I'll meet along the way!
