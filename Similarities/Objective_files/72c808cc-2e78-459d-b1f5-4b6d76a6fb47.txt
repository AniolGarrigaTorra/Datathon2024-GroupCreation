Here's my objective: For this datathon, my goal is to create an amazing experience by making new friends, having fun, and soaking up as many events as possible. I'm excited to learn new skills, but I'm also looking forward to meeting fellow participants, bonding over our shared interest in data, and maybe even discovering some hidden talents. I'm all about good vibes and a relaxed atmosphere, so I'm aiming to be approachable, supportive, and willing to lend a helping hand whenever possible. Can't wait to see what this datathon brings! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lie, a 19-year-old student diving into the world of data for the first time. I'm excited to meet fellow participants who share my passion for discovery and learning. When I'm not studying, you can find me geeking out over gaming, health, and productivity. I love finding innovative ways to make life easier, which is why I'm drawn to Robotic Process Automation. I'm all about good vibes and relaxed atmospheres, so I'll be the one sipping on a latte, ready to collaborate and have some fun. Let's get this datathon started and create some unforgettable experiences together!
