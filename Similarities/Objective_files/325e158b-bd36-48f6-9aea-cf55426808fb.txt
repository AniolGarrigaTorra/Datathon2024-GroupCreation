Hey, it's me, Llezaray! For this datathon, my main objective is to learn and level up my skills. I've had some solid hackathon experience under my belt, but I know there's always room for growth. I'm excited to dive into new tech and methodologies, and take away some valuable insights to bring back to my degree. I'm not really competition-focused, so don't expect me to be pushing the boundaries to win. But I am looking forward to collaborating with other participants, attending workshops, and leaving this event a more confident developer! Hey there! I'm Llezaray, a 19-year-old university student, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! As an aspiring developer, I've had a bit of a coding journey so far, and I'm looking forward to leveling up my skills here. When I'm not buried in books, I'm probably tinkering with tech projects or gaming on my downtime. I'm really passionate about exploring the intersection of tech and other fields, like communication and health. I'm all about learning, growth, and collaboration, so you can bet I'll be soaking up all the insights and workshops I can get!
