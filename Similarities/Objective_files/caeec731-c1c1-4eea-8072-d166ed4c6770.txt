Hey there! So, my objective for this datathon is to have a blast while making new friends and trying out as many events as possible. I'm not super competitive when it comes to winning, so I'm more focused on learning new stuff, jamming with others, and taking in the datathon vibes. I'm all about meeting new people, discovering fresh skills, and sharing a laugh or two. If I happen to score a win along the way, awesome! But my main goal is to leave here feeling inspired, exhausted, and maybe a little wiser, but mostly just stoked that I participated! Hey there! I'm Asher, a third-year student with a passion for tech and gaming. When I'm not crushing coding problems or grinding on new levels, I'm hooked on learning new stuff. My favorite way to spend my free time is messing around with databases or building something entirely new from scratch. This datathon is my chance to hang out with fellow coding enthusiasts, learn from the pros, and maybe even create some amazing projects together. I'm all about having a blast and taking in the experience - let's make some memories and grow as coders together!
