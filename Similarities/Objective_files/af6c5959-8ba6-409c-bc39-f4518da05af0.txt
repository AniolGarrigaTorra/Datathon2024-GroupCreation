For me, this datathon is all about leveling up my skills! As a sophomore with limited but growing experience in programming, I'm excited to dive deep into new technologies and workflows. My objective is to challenge myself, learn as much as possible, and refine my programming abilities. I'm hoping to collaborate with like-minded individuals, take on new projects, and gain exposure to industry-specific tools and languages. My goal is to leave this datathon feeling confident in my newfound knowledge and ready to tackle more complex projects in my studies and potential future endeavors. Hey!
