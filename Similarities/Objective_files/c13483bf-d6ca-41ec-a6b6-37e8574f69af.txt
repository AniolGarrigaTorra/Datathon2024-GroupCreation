Hey! As I sign up for this datathon, my goal is super clear: I want to have a blast with fellow data enthusiasts and make some amazing new friends! I'm looking forward to participating in as many events as possible, from workshops to pitches, and just absorbing as much info as I can. I don't care about winning or getting the perfect score - for me, it's all about enjoying the experience, meeting like-minded people, and having a great time. Bring on the data and the laughter! Hey there! I'm Eva, a 17-year-old student here to geek out with fellow data enthusiasts. I'm relatively new to the coding scene, but I'm super excited to dive deeper into the world of data. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or exploring the mysteries of quantum mechanics. For me, this datathon is all about making new friends, learning something new, and having an absolute blast. I'm all about embracing the experience and letting the data roll in - bring it on!
