I'm here to win, no games. I've got a competitive streak and I hate losing, especially to my peers. I know some people come to datathons for the socializing, but not me - I'm focused on coming out on top. I want to learn new techniques and coding skills, but my primary goal is to solve the challenge in the most efficient way possible and take home that prize. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so expect me to be glued to my screen and fueled by caffeine until we emerge victorious! Hey, I'm Montserrat Langley. I'm a competitive and driven 18-year-old who's always up for a challenge. I'm in my first year of studying programming and am eager to put my skills to the test. I've got a passion for building innovative solutions and taking on new problems. For this datathon, my goal is to come out on top - no messing around. I'm all about precision, speed, and efficiency. With a constant flow of caffeine fueling me, I'm ready to stay glued to my screen and give it my all to emerge victorious!
