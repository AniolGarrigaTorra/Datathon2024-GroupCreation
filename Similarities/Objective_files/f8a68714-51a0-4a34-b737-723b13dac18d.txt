As someone who's dipped their toes in the world of coding through hackathons and university projects, I'm excited to join this datathon with a focus on leveling up my skills. I'm looking to take this opportunity to dive deeper into new techniques, tools, and datasets, and challenge myself to learn and experiment more aggressively. Specifically, I hope to master data visualization and develop a stronger grasp of statistical modeling. Ultimately, I'm hoping to gain valuable experience, build a portfolio of projects, and grow as a developer. Hey there! I'm Sofia, an 18-year-old university student with a passion for coding and exploring new technologies. I've had a taste of the world of programming through hackathons and university projects, but I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis, visualizing insights, and statistical modeling. With a curiosity for creative applications, I'm also drawn to emerging tech like AR/VR and e-commerce innovations. I'm looking forward to collaborative learning and innovation at this datathon, and I'm confident that it will challenge and inspire me to achieve my goals.
