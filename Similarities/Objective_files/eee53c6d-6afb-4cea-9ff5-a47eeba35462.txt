Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is super chill - I'm all about making new friends, having an amazing time, and taking part in as many cool events as I can. I love meeting fellow tech enthusiasts and learning from others, but more than that, I want to build some awesome memories with my new buddies. I'll be all over the venue, trying out demos, attending workshops, and participating in every hack I can find! Count me in for datathon shenanigans! Hey there! I'm Sophie, a third-year student excited to take part in this datathon! When I'm not crushing deadlines, you can find me jamming to music or tinkering with art projects. I've got a thing for productiveness, always trying to stay ahead of the curve, and enterprise software doesn't have to mean boring - I believe it can be beautiful! My friends would say I'm easy-going and always up for an adventure, so I'm looking forward to making new buddies and just enjoying the ride. Let's get this datathon started and have some fun!
