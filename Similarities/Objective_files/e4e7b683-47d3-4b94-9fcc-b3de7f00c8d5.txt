My objective for this datathon is to step up my game and take away some sweet new skills. I'm all about improving my programming skills and diving deeper into the world of data analysis. I'm hoping to learn new techniques, work on projects that challenge me, and maybe even pick up some new languages or tools. My aim is to walk away from this datathon feeling more confident and prepared for my future career. Bring on the challenges! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 22-year-old student with a passion for bridging the gap between technology and creativity. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of programming, design, and communication, which drives my enthusiasm for this datathon. I'm eager to challenge myself and expand my skillset in data analysis. With some experience in programming languages and computer vision, I'm excited to take on new projects and learn from the best minds in the industry. I'm all about continuous learning, experimentation, and innovation - and I'm stoked to be a part of this datathon adventure!
