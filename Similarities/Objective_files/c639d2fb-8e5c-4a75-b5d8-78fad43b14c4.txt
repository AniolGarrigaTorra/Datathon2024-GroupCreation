Hey! I'm Ana Maria, and for this datathon, I'm all about having a blast! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, making some awesome connections, and just having a fun time. I'm not super competitive, so I'm not worried about winning (although, who knows, it's always exciting!). I want to participate in as many events and activities as I can, learn some new stuff, and enjoy the vibes. Most importantly, I want to make new friends and take some amazing memories away from this datathon. Hey there! I'm Ana Maria, a 2nd-year student with a passion for making a positive impact through technology. When I'm not studying, you can find me tinkering with code or designing innovative solutions. I'm all about collaborating with others and learning from their experiences. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to network, learn some new skills, and contribute to meaningful projects. I'm excited to meet like-minded individuals and create lasting connections. Let's have some fun and make a difference together!
