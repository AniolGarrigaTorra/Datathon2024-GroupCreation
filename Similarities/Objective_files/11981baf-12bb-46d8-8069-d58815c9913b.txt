For me, the ultimate goal of this datathon is to level up my skills and learn something new. I'm always on the lookout for ways to challenge myself and improve my programming chops. I'm not necessarily in it to win it (although, let's be real, it'd be cool to take home the prize). My main focus is on building projects, experimenting with new tools and technologies, and honing my problem-solving skills. By the end of the weekend, I hope to have gained some valuable knowledge and a killer project to add to my portfolio! Hey there! I'm Sophia, a second-year student with a passion for learning and innovation. When I'm not hitting the books, I love tackling coding challenges and experimenting with new technologies. I've been hooked on programming for a while now, and my go-to playground is usually the world of databases. I'm all about building things that make a difference, and I'm excited to take on this datathon to push my skills and creativity to the next level. Let's see what awesome projects we can create together!
