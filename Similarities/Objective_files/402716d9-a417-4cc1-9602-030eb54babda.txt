As a 21-year-old student, I'm all about growth and development, so my objective for this datathon is to dive deep into the challenges and learn as much as I can about data science and analysis. I'm excited to collaborate with others, but my primary goal is to refine my programming skills and apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. I'd love to take away new techniques, approaches, and best practices to improve my own projects and eventually contribute to real-world applications. Hi everyone! I'm Sofia Riviera, a 21-year-old student with a passion for growth and development. When I'm not hitting the books, I love diving into the world of coding and data analysis. With an eye towards making a real-world impact, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to refine my skills and tackle new challenges. I'm excited to join this datathon, where I can learn from others, share my own knowledge, and take on real-world problems to make a meaningful difference. Let's collaborate, learn, and have some fun together!
