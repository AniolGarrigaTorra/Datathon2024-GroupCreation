My main objective for this datathon is to go all out and give it my best shot to win. I've got my sights set on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the extra effort to get it. I've had some experience with hackathons in the past, but I'm looking to take my skills to the next level and prove myself against other talented participants. I'm not going to settle for anything less than first place, so expect me to be focused and determined throughout the datathon! Hey everyone! I'm Llu√≠s Edward, a 20-year-old student with a passion for making a difference through technology. I've had a solid foundation in programming and have experimented with various languages, but I'm constantly looking to improve and take on new challenges. When I'm not studying, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in robotic process automation or browsing open-source projects. I thrive in fast-paced environments and thrive under pressure, which is why I'm super excited to be here at this datathon. Bring it on, and let's create something amazing!
