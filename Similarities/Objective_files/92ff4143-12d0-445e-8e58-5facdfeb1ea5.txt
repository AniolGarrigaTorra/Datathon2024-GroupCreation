My objective for this datathon is to immerse myself in a world of data and push my skills to the next level. I've got a solid foundation in programming, but I know there's so much more to learn. I want to explore new tools, techniques, and methodologies to boost my confidence and take my coding game to the next level. Whether it's working on personal projects or collaborating with others, I'm all about diving in, staying curious, and constantly improving my skills. Hi, I'm Alessandra! I'm a second-year student with a passion for learning and taking on new challenges. In my free time, I explore my creative side through music and art, but I'm also intrigued by the innovative applications of technology. I'm excited to dive into the world of data and push my skills to the next level. This datathon is an opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, collaborate with others, and develop new techniques and tools. I'm all about staying curious and improving my skills, and I'm thrilled to be here!
