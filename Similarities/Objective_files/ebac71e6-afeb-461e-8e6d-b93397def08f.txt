Hey! My objective for this datathon is to geek out and learn as much as I can. As a 3rd-year student with a passion for programming, I'm eager to gain more skills and knowledge in data analysis. I want to dive into new technologies, techniques, and datasets, and walk away from this event with a bag full of new ideas and a clearer understanding of what I'm capable of. Of course, I'll also try to make some new friends and connections along the way, but my main focus is on personal growth and development. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm El√≠sabet, a third-year student with a passion for programming. When I'm not buried in books or coding away, I love exploring new technologies and how they can be used to drive positive change. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, not just to win (although that would be awesome), but to geek out and learn as much as I can. I'm looking forward to diving into new datasets and techniques, and coming away from this with a newfound sense of capability and direction. Let's get this datathon started!
