For me, this datathon is all about connections and vibes! As a second-year student, I'm not looking to necessarily come in first place or win the competition. Instead, I want to make the most of this experience and meet awesome people who share similar interests. I'm looking forward to participating in various events, learning new things, and just having a blast with the team. I want to take away memories, friendships, and maybe even some inspiration to keep pushing my skills. Let's have fun and make this datathon an unforgettable experience! Hi there! I'm Laura Ferrera, a 19-year-old student looking to make the most out of this datathon experience. As a second-year student, I'm excited to dive into new challenges and connections. When I'm not coding away, I'm often found exploring the intersection of tech and humanity - whether that's AR/VR experiences or finding innovative ways to improve healthcare. For me, this datathon is all about vibing with like-minded individuals, learning from each other, and maybe even inspiring future projects. I'm stoked to be a part of this adventure and see where it takes us!
