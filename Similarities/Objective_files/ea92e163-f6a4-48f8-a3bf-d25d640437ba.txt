My objective for this datathon is to create a blast and make the most of this amazing experience. I'm all about meeting new people, learning through workshops and networking with fellow participants. I want to have fun, participate in as many events as possible, and come away with new skills and friends. I'm not too hung up on winning or being the best, but instead, I'm excited to immerse myself in the datathon vibe and soak up all the excitement and energy. Let's do this! Hey! I'm Aur√©lien, a curious and adventurous 18-year-old student, currently soaking up the college experience. I'm always up for a challenge and love trying new things - that's why I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! I've got a sweet spot for programming and design, and I'm excited to meet like-minded folks and learn through this amazing experience. Expect me to be chatty, always up for a good laugh, and totally enthusiastic about pretty much everything! Let's have an awesome time and make some unforgettable memories!
