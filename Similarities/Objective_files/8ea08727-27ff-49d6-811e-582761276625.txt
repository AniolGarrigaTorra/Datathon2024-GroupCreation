Hey there! I'm Lena, and I'm all about coming out on top at this datathon. My objective is to win, plain and simple. I've participated in five hackathons before, and I know what it takes to deliver. I'm looking to push myself to new heights, solve complex problems, and emerge victorious. I'm not here to make friends (although that's always a bonus!), I'm here to show everyone what I'm capable of. I want to leave this datathon feeling proud of what I've accomplished and ready to take on the world! Hey there! I'm Lena Kramer, a third-year student with a can-do attitude and a passion for problem-solving. I've got a solid foundation in programming, having dabbled in Java and dabbled in React Native. I'm always looking to push the boundaries of what's possible and take on new challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over cutting-edge tech like computer vision and IoT. I'm all about innovation and creativity, and I'm excited to see what this datathon brings! Can't wait to get started and make some unforgettable memories.
