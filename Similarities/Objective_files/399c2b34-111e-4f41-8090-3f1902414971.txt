I'm all about having a blast and making memories at this datathon! My objective is to surround myself with like-minded people and have an absolute riot while learning new skills. I'm excited to attend all the talks, workshops, and events I can, not just to improve my coding skills but also to mingle, share stories, and build friendships. Let's keep it social, relaxed, and FUN! Bring on the food, drinks, and good vibes - I'm ready to soak it all in and make this datathon an unforgettable experience! Hey, I'm Alejandro! I'm a 2nd-year student still figuring things out, but I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm all about having a blast with fellow enthusiasts who share my passion for tech and social good. When I'm not busy with coursework, I love tinkering with code, experimenting with new frameworks, and diving into projects that make a difference. I'm easygoing, always up for a good chat, and can't wait to connect with like-minded folks while making unforgettable memories. Let's get this party started and have an awesome time!
