As a curious and adventurous participant, I'm looking to make this datathon a blast! My objective is to have as much fun as possible while making new friends and taking part in as many events as I can. I'm not super experienced in programming, but I'm eager to learn and get a feel for the vibe of the community. For me, it's all about being immersed in the excitement of it all, trying out new things, and meeting like-minded folks who share my passion for tech. Let's make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Merc√® Elena Thompson, and I'm stoked to be joining this datathon! I'm a 18-year-old newbie to the world of coding, but I'm super eager to dive in and learn as much as I can. I'm a curious and adventurous soul who loves trying new things and meeting like-minded folks. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me geeking out over the latest gaming trends or jamming out to my favorite tunes. I'm all about immersing myself in the excitement of it all and making unforgettable memories! See you around!
