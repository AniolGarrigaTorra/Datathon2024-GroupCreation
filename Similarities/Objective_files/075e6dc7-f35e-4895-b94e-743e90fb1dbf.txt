Hey there! So, I'm Sofía, and for this datathon, I'm all about having a blast! My objective is to make some awesome friends, have a ton of fun, and participate in as many events as possible. I've been to a few hackathons before, but this one feels different - I want to step outside my comfort zone and try new things. I'm stoked to collaborate with people from all over, learn new skills, and share laughs together. Bring on the fun and games - I'm ready to roll! Hey! I'm Sofía, a 20-year-old student who's always up for a challenge. I'm on a mission to break out of my comfort zone and try new things. I've had some experience with coding, but I'm eager to level up and learn from others. I'm passionate about tech and art, and I love experimenting with music and visuals in my free time. When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing or jamming out to my fave tunes. I'm stoked to meet fellow datathon participants and make some unforgettable memories. Let's make some noise and crush this datathon!
