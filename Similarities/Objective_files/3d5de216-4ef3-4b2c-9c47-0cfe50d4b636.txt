Hi! I'm Ava Lane, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to make some amazing friends, have a blast, and experience all the amazing events and activities they have to offer. I've heard these things can be super competitive, but that's just not my vibe. I'm all about learning new skills and having fun while doing it. I'm an 18-year-old newbie, and I'm hoping to soak up as much knowledge as I can while mingling with like-minded people. Bring on the coding marathons and social events - I'm ready to make some unforgettable memories! Hey everyone, I'm Ava Lane! I'm 18, a first-year student, and a programming newbie. I'm all about embracing the unknown and learning as I go. In my free time, I love discovering lifehacks and shortcuts to make my life easier, and I'm stoked to combine that enthusiasm with data analysis at the datathon. I'm looking forward to a fun and social experience, surrounded by like-minded folks. Expect to find me bouncing between coding marathons and social events, always eager to connect and learn from the best!
