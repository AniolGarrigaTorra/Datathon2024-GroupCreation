Hey there! My name is Maya, and I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon! As a first-year student with limited coding experience, I want to make the most of this opportunity to improve my skills and learn new things. My objective is to take a step back, focus on the challenges and tutorials, and push myself to try new programming languages, tools, and techniques. I'm not too fussed about winning - I'd much rather spend my time absorbing knowledge, asking questions, and collaborating with others who are equally eager to learn. Bring on the data science awesomeness! Hi there! I'm Maya, a 19-year-old student diving into the world of data science for the first time. I'm super excited to challenge myself and learn as much as I can during this datathon. My goal is to take it easy, focus on the tasks, and experiment with new programming languages and tools. I'm not too worried about being the best, just about enjoying the ride and learning as much as I can. Let's do this!
