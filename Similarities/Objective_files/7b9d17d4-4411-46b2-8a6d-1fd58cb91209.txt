I'm all about making the most of my datathon experience. I'm excited to mingle with fellow participants, learn new things, and take part in as many events as I can. For me, it's not about the competition - it's about making new friends and memories that'll last a lifetime. I'm looking forward to soaking up the atmosphere, exploring new coding challenges, and having a blast with my fellow datathon-ers! Hey, I'm Sof√≠a! I'm a 20-year-old third-year student, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. I'm all about learning and exploring new tech trends, and I love experimenting with different tools and techniques. My passion lies in combining creativity with innovation, and I believe that AI and art can have a real impact on society. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me jamming with friends or scouring the latest blockbusters. I'm looking forward to meeting you all and seeing what awesome things we can create together!
