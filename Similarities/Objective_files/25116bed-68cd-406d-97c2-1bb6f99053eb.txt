My objective for this datathon is to absorb as much as I can and level up my skills! As a student with an intermediate level of programming experience, I'm eager to dive into new technologies, languages, and concepts. I'm excited to learn from others, attend workshops, and work on challenging projects that push me out of my comfort zone. I want to walk away from this event with new tools, insights, and a tangible portfolio of work that showcases my growth and progress. Let the learning begin! Hey there! I'm Ruby, a curious and ambitious 21-year-old student diving into the world of data. I'm no stranger to programming, having already picked up TypeScript, Flask, and some other skills. My real passion is finding creative solutions to complex problems. When I'm not poring over code, you can find me exploring new technologies or perfecting my AR/VR gaming skills. I'm excited to push my limits, learn from others, and take home new skills and experiences from this datathon. Bring on the challenge!
