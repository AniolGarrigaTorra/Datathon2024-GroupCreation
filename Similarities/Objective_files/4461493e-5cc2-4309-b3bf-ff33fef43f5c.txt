Hey there! I'm Evelyn, and I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon. For me, it's all about learning and improving my skills. I'm a beginner in programming, and this is the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into new tools and techniques. I'm looking forward to hands-on experiences, coding sprints, and insightful workshops. My objective is to push myself outside of my comfort zone, master some new skills, and walk away with a greater understanding of data science and its applications. Can't wait to see what this weekend brings! Hey! I'm Evelyn Winchester, a 17-year-old student looking forward to diving into the world of data science at this datathon.
