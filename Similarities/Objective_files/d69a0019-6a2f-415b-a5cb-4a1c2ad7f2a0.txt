Hey there! I'm Sofía and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon. My main goal is to have an amazing time with like-minded individuals and create some unforgettable memories. I'm not too worried about winning (although it'd be cool to take home a prize or two); I'm more focused on soaking up as much knowledge and fun as possible. I want to meet new people, collaborate on creative projects, and be part of an awesome community vibe. Let's do this and have an epic adventure together! Hey there! I'm Sofía Flynn, a 21-year-old student with a passion for using technology to make a positive impact. I've been experimenting with code for a few years now, and I'm excited to see what this datathon brings. For me, it's all about the people - I love collaborating with others who share my enthusiasm for coding and social good. Outside of coding, you can find me lost in books on quantum physics or daydreaming about running my own startup. I'm stoked to be here, and I'm looking forward to the adventure ahead!
