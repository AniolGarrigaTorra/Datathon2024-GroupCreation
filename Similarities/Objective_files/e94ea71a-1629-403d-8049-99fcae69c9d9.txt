Hey there! I'm Elsa, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! For me, it's all about having an amazing time with fellow coding enthusiasts. I'm looking forward to making new friends, participating in fun events, and experiencing the datathon vibes. My goal is to be present, engaged, and embracing of this experience. I want to step outside my comfort zone, learn new things, and get energized by the electric atmosphere. No intense competition or all-night coding marathons for me - I'm all about soaking up the datathon goodness and making memories with fellow participants! Hey everyone, I'm Elsa! I'm a 19-year-old student eager to dive into this datathon. I've got a solid foundation in programming and I'm all about learning and growing. When I'm not studying, I love exploring the intersection of technology and social good - there's something about using code to make a positive impact that gets me pumped! I'm here to have a blast with fellow coding enthusiasts, challenge myself, and soak up all the datathon vibes. Let's have an awesome time and make some unforgettable memories!
