My objective for this datathon is to come out with some amazing new buddies and a ton of awesome memories. I don't really care about the winning, I just wanna soak up the datathon vibes and have a blast. I'm excited to learn new things, but not as interested in pushing myself to win. My goal is to participate in as many cool events as possible, try out new tools and techniques, and just generally enjoy the ride. If we can grab some beers and chat about our shared passion for tech, even better! Hey! I'm Sofia, a 2nd-year student with a passion for tech. I've been messing around with programming for a bit, and I'm always excited to learn new things and meet fellow tech enthusiasts. I'm all about building cool stuff that makes a difference, and I'm not afraid to ask for help. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places, reading tech blogs, or jamming out to my favorite tunes. I'm stoked to be at this datathon and looking forward to soaking up the vibes, making new friends, and leveling up my skills!
