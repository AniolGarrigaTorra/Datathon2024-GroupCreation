Hi! I'm Aina, and I'm stoked to be joining this datathon. My goal is to have a blast and soak up all the excitement! I'm looking forward to meeting new people and making friends. I'm all about fostering a sense of community and sharing my learnings with others. Besides getting familiar with some cool tech and learning from experienced participants, I hope to laugh, joke, and enjoy this experience with an awesome group of people. Let's make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Aina, a first-year student super excited to be part of this datathon. I'm all about creating a vibe of inclusivity and sharing knowledge with my fellow participants. I've had some experience with programming, but I'm still a beginner, so I'm looking forward to learning and growth. My favorite domains are enterprise, fintech, and health, as I find them really fascinating and I'd love to tackle real-world problems. Let's have some fun and make new friends while learning and growing together!
