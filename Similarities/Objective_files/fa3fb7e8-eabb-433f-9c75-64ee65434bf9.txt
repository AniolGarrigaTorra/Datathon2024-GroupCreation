For this datathon, my main goal is to have a blast and make meaningful connections with fellow participants! I'm excited to dive into all the fun events, workshops, and activities, and learn alongside fellow enthusiasts. I'm hoping to leave with a new network of friends, a fresh perspective on data innovation, and some unforgettable memories. Don't get me wrong, I won't shy away from a good problem-solving challenge or two, but let's be real - the social aspect is what I'm really looking forward to! Hey there! I'm Sophia, a 20-year-old student passionate about tech and innovation. I'm a data enthusiast, always looking for new ways to make data come alive. When I'm not in class, you can find me exploring the world of AR/VR, cybersecurity, or even just hanging out with friends. For this datathon, I'm super stoked to connect with fellow data fans, learn from their experiences, and take on some awesome challenges. I'm all about creating meaningful relationships and making memories - and who knows, maybe a few great ideas will come out of it too!
