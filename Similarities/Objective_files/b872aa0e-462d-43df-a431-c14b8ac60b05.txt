For me, this datathon is all about learning and growth. I'm an intermediate programmer with a solid foundation, but I want to take it to the next level. I'm hoping to dive deeper into specific areas, like data visualization and machine learning, and learn from the expert mentors and fellow participants. I'd love to tackle some challenging problems and push my skills to the limit. Most importantly, I'm excited to share knowledge, get feedback, and see what I can learn from others - this is a great opportunity for me to refine my skills and build confidence as a developer. Hey everyone! I'm Aurora, a 20-year-old third-year student. When I'm not busy with academics, I love geeking out over programming and all the cool stuff it can do. I'm at the intermediate level, but I'm eager to take it to the next level! This datathon feels like the perfect opportunity for me to do that - I'm stoked to learn new skills, tackle some challenging problems, and get feedback from others. My ultimate goal is to be a rockstar developer, and I think this datathon will be a huge step in that direction. Can't wait to meet you all and get started!
