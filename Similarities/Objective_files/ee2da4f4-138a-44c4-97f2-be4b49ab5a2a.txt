For me, datathons are an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to learn something new. As a junior in computer science, I'm eager to dive deeper into data science and expand my skill set. This datathon, my objective is to soak up as much knowledge as possible and experiment with various tools and techniques. I'm excited to collaborate with others, ask lots of questions, and get feedback on my work. Ultimately, I want to come out of this datathon feeling more confident in my abilities and inspired to take on even more data science projects. Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a junior computer science student, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon. I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to step out of my comfort zone. With a passion for tinkering and learning, I'm excited to dive into the world of data science. I've had some experience with programming languages like Python and Go, and I've even dabbled in blockchain and IoT projects. I'm eager to learn more, collaborate with others, and explore new tools and techniques. Let's get hacking and see what cool projects we can come up with!
