Hey there! I'm Alessia, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon! I'm all about having a blast and making memories, so my objective is to make new friends, have fun, and participate in as many events as possible. I'm not looking to win, and I'm not super focused on improving my skills just yet. I'm just here to chill, learn from others, and be a part of this amazing community. Bring on the ping-pong tournaments, karaoke sessions, and team lunches - I'm ready to make this datathon an unforgettable experience! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a fourth-year student with a passion for innovation. When I'm not hitting the books, I love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I can meet like-minded individuals and have some serious fun. My goal is to soak up the energy, make new friends, and maybe even bust out some sick ping-pong skills. Expect me to be the one jamming out to tunes or scribbling away in my sketchbook - I'm all about artistic expression and a dash of nerdy charm!
