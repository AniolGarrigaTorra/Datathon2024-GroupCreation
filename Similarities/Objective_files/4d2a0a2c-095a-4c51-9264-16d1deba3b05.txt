My objective for this datathon is to really dig deep and challenge myself to learn new things and level up my skills. As an undergrad, I've only been programming for a few years, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. I'm hoping this datathon will give me the opportunity to explore new tools, frameworks, and methodologies, and come away with a stronger foundation in data analysis and manipulation. I'm not super competitive, so I don't care about winning - I just want to walk away feeling like I've grown as a programmer and a person. Hey, I'm Ainoa Fontaine! I'm a 20-year-old third-year student with a passion for using data to drive innovation. I've been programming for a few years, but I know I've only scratched the surface. I'm excited to challenge myself and learn new skills at the datathon. Outside of class, I love experimenting with tech that can make a difference, from e-commerce to social good. My goal is to grow as a programmer and a person, and I'm not too worried about winning - just about leveling up and having fun with fellow coders!
