Here's my objective:

My goal for this datathon is to make the most of the experience and have a blast! I'm excited to mingle with fellow datathon enthusiasts, learn from their projects, and share my own knowledge. I want to participate in as many workshops, hack sessions, and events as I can, and soak up the vibe. I'm more interested in having fun and creating new memories than worrying about winning. Bring on the laughter, networking, and collective geekery - I'm ready to make some amazing connections! Hey, I'm Alexa! I'm a student in my fourth year, and I'm all about tech, innovation, and creative problem-solving. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me building apps or fiddling with code - I love exploring the intersection of programming and design. My real passion, though, is making a difference through tech. I'm all about empowering individuals and businesses to be more efficient, effective, and sustainable. I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon crew, and I'm already planning some amazing conversations!
