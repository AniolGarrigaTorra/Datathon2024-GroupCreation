Hey! I'm Zoë, and for this datathon, my objective is pretty straightforward: I want to focus on learning and improving my skills. I'm an intermediate coder, but I'm eager to dig deeper and tackle more complex problems. I'm looking forward to soaking up knowledge from the expert mentors, and to be challenged by the datathon's complex datasets. My goal is to walk away from this event with a new skill or two under my belt, and a sense of accomplishment that comes from pushing myself outside my comfort zone. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Zoë, a 21-year-old student with a passion for learning and tinkering with tech. I've got an intermediate level of coding experience, and I'm looking to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. I'm excited to work on challenging projects and collaborate with other talented individuals. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the world of AI, Fintech, and Productivity. I'm all about innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Let's get started and see what we can achieve together!
