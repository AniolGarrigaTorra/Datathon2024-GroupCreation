Hey, it's me, Antoine! My objective for this datathon is to make some amazing friends, have a blast, and soak up as many experiences as I can. I'm all about vibing with fellow participants, sharing stories, and picking each other's brains. I'm hoping to attend panels, join workshops, and jam out with the dev community. Bring on the swag, the laughter, and the memories! My goal is to leave with new connections, a spring in my step, and a sense of adventure. I'm in it for the ride, and I'm stoked to share it with everyone! Hey, I'm Antoine! I'm a 19-year-old student with a passion for creativity and innovation. I'm a bit of a curious cat, always exploring new worlds, whether that's through music, art, or the latest tech trends. I'm all about vibing with others, learning from their experiences, and sharing my own. At the datathon, I'm looking to level up my network, spark new ideas, and leave with a spring in my step. Let's jam out, trade stories, and make some unforgettable memories!
