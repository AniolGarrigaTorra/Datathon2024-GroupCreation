Hey! So, my main objective for this datathon is to give it my all and win. I'm all about being competitive, and the thrill of victory is what drives me. I'm willing to put in the long hours and hustle to make sure I come out on top. My goal is to complete as many challenges as possible, learn from my mistakes, and adapt quickly to the problems we're faced with. I'm ready to go head-to-head with the best and give it my 110%. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Luiza! I'm a 20-year-old student with a competitive streak a mile wide. When I'm not hitting the books, I love diving into cutting-edge tech and innovation. Fintech and IoT excite me, and I've already had a taste of designing and building things. I'm no stranger to putting in the long hours to master new skills. I thrive under pressure, so I'm stoked to be here for the datathon. Bring on the challenges, and let's get this party started!
