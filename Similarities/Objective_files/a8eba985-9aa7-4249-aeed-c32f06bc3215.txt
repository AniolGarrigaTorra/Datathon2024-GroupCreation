My goal for this datathon is to step outside my comfort zone and have an amazing experience. I'm looking forward to making new friends and connections, having fun with my teammates, and enjoying the different events and activities. I'm not too worried about winning - my focus is on being part of the datathon spirit and soaking up as much as I can from the sessions and workshops. Bring on the datathon vibes and memories to cherish! Hey there! I'm Sophia, a 20-year-old student with a thirst for adventure and a passion for tech. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or fiddling with code. I'm no programming pro, but I'm always up for a challenge. My friends would describe me as friendly and optimistic, and I'm really excited to bring my energy and enthusiasm to the datathon. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, learning new skills, and making unforgettable memories. Let's do this!
