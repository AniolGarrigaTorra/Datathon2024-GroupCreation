Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to make some amazing memories, network with awesome people, and have a blast while doing it. I'm excited to participate in as many events as possible, from workshops to pitches, and learn new skills while having fun with the team. I'm not too fussed about competing for prizes, but I'm more interested in taking part in the experience, sharing laughs, and discovering what makes this datathon unique. My goal is to leave here feeling inspired, connected, and inspired to take on new challenges! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 20-year-old student with a curious mind and a passion for learning. I'm in my third year, and I've been building my skills in tech, from web development to design and beyond. I love solving problems and making things happen. Outside of code, I'm a people person who appreciates great communication and a good sense of humor. I'm excited to dive into the datathon experience, learn from others, and have a blast with like-minded individuals. Let's make some amazing memories together!
