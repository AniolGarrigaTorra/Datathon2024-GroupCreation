My objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I've got a solid foundation in programming from my degree, but I want to dive deeper into new technologies and techniques. I'm excited to work on real-world projects and receive feedback from experienced mentors. I'm not competing to win; I'm competing with myself to learn and grow. I hope to take away new skills and a refreshed perspective on data science by the end of the event. Hey! I'm Sònia, a 19-year-old university student with a passion for building innovative tech solutions. I've had a taste of programming and I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. For this datathon, I'm all about growth - I want to learn new technologies, explore cutting-edge concepts, and refine my approach. As a detail-oriented person with a keen interest in how things work, I'm excited to dive into the world of data science and see what cool projects I can create. I'm all about learning and self-improvement, so watch out for a refreshed, revved-up Sònia by the end of this datathon!
