Hey! I'm super stoked to be part of this datathon! As a second-year student, I'm more about vibin' with the squad, learning new chill programming tricks, and having a blast. Don't get me wrong, I love a good competition, but this time I'm focused on making friends, participating in events, and just enjoying the ride. I'm all about creating an awesome datathon experience - whether that's through jamming on a project or belting out karaoke at the hackathon karaoke night Hey there! I'm Evelyn, an 18-year-old student stoked to be part of this datathon! I'm all about vibing with the squad and having a blast while learning new cool programming tricks. When I'm not geeking out over Fintech, AR, or Communication, you can find me belting out karaoke tunes or plotting my next productivity hack. As a student, I'm passionate about using tech to make a difference - whether that's through building innovative projects or helping others level up their skills. Can't wait to jam with you and make this datathon unforgettable!
