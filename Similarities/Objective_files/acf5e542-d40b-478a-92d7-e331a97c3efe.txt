I'm Sofía, and my objective for this datathon is to have a blast! I'm excited to meet fellow coders and data enthusiasts, learn from each other's experiences, and share my own knowledge. I'd love to participate in every possible event, from workshops to hackathons, and soak up as much information as I can. For me, datathons are a great way to make new friends and have fun while learning. I'm looking forward to an incredible weekend of collaboration, exploration, and just having a good time with awesome people like you! Hey there! I'm Sofía, a third-year student excited to be a part of this datathon! I'm all about learning new things and connecting with like-minded people. As someone with a curious mind and a passion for problem-solving, I love tackling challenges and coming up with creative solutions. I've got some experience with programming and design, and I'm always looking to improve my skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over new tech trends, social justice, or simply enjoying a good book. Can't wait to meet you all and see what awesome experiences we'll have this weekend!
