My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win. As a seasoned hackathon veteran, I've learned from past experiences and I'm more determined than ever to take home the top prize. I've put in the extra hours to hone my skills and I'm confident in my ability to tackle even the most challenging problems. My goal is to not only impress the judges but also to outdo my competition. Bring it on! I'm ready to put everything on the line and give it my all to emerge victorious. Hey, I'm Merc√® Vilarrasa! I'm a second-year student with a passion for coding and a knack for productivity. I've had some great experiences at hackathons in the past, but I'm back to take it to the next level. My focus is on artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I'm eager to put my skills to the test. I'm a bit of a competition beast, so bring it on! I'm looking forward to seeing what this datathon has in store for me and my teammates. Let's do this!
