For me, datathons are all about leveling up my skills. I've participated in a few hackathons before, and I loved the rush of creating something from scratch under pressure. But this time, I'm focusing on what I can learn, not just what I can win. I want to improve my data visualization chops, dive deeper into machine learning, and maybe even pick up some new languages or tools. My goal is to come out of this weekend with a fresh set of skills and a renewed confidence in my abilities as a programmer. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Leonie, a 20-year-old student with a passion for coding and making a positive impact. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but this time I'm focusing on leveling up my skills and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. I'm excited to explore new technologies and tools, and to learn how to apply them to real-world problems. When I'm not geeking out over code, you can find me experimenting with new AR/VR experiences or attending tech conferences to stay up-to-date on the latest trends. I'm stoked to be here and see what this datathon has in store!
