Hey! My objective for this datathon is pretty straightforward - I want to learn as much as I can and improve my skills! I'm just starting out with programming and I know I still have a lot to learn, so I'm super excited to dive in and absorb as many new things as possible. I'm looking forward to learning from the experts, getting feedback from others, and maybe even taking away some new tools and techniques to add to my toolkit. Bring it on, and let the learning begin! Hey there! I'm Elisabet, a 19-year-old student excited to join this datathon adventure! I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to programming, but I'm eager to dive in and learn as much as I can. With a focus on improving my skills, I'm looking forward to getting feedback from experts and gaining insight into the world of data science. My experience with Figma has already given me a taste of the creative problem-solving I'm hoping to develop further during this event. I'm all about growth and learning, and this datathon seems like the perfect opportunity to make it happen!
