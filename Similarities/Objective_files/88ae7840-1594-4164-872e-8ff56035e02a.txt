Hey, I'm Sofía! For this datathon, I'm looking forward to a fun and relaxed experience. My goal is to meet new people, make friends, and get swept up in the excitement. I'm not too concerned with winning or competing at the highest level - I just want to soak up all the amazing opportunities and events this datathon has to offer. Whether it's learning from industry experts, attending workshops, or just hanging out with fellow participants, I'm all about vibing with others and making unforgettable memories. Let's have an awesome time! Hi! I'm Sofía, a 20-year-old student with a passion for making a positive impact through tech. I'm all about embracing the intersection of enterprise, innovation, and social good. When I'm not sipping coffee or jamming out to indie tunes, you can find me geeking out over design and productivity hacks. This datathon is a chance for me to connect with like-minded folks, level up my skills, and simply soak up the energy. I'm looking forward to a weekend of laughter, inspiration, and new friendships. Bring it on!
