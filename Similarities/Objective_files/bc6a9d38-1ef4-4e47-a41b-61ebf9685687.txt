My main goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and take my learning to the next level. I'm eager to dive into new challenges and tackle real-world problems, learning from the experience and adapting my programming chops along the way. I'm not overly concerned with winning - it's about the journey, not the destination for me. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other developers, sharing knowledge, and gaining new insights to enrich my portfolio. My aim is to emerge from this datathon a better programmer and a more confident problem-solver. Hi everyone! I'm VÃ­ctor, a 20-year-old coding enthusiast studying computer science. I'm excited to be part of this datathon and level up my skills. I'm all about tackling real-world problems and learning from the process. Music and art have always been my outlets for creativity, but I'm eager to channel that energy into solving complex challenges. I believe collaboration is key to growth, so I'm looking forward to working with like-minded individuals to tackle new problems and create innovative solutions. Let's learn and have fun together!
