Hey there! As a part of the datathon, I'm stoked to be focusing on making new friends, having an amazing time, and getting to participate in as many events as possible! For me, this experience is all about stepping out of my comfort zone, meeting like-minded people, and creating unforgettable memories. I'm excited to collaborate with others, learn from them, and grow together. Bring on the good vibes and new connections! Let's have some serious fun! Hey there! I'm Ana, a 19-year-old student with a passion for innovation and creative problem-solving. I've been dable-ing with code for a while now, and I'm excited to be a part of this datathon. When I'm not digging into algorithms or learning new languages, you can find me playing music, creating art, or devouring the latest sci-fi novels. I'm all about connecting with like-minded individuals, sharing knowledge, and laughing together. Here, I hope to challenge myself, explore new horizons, and build lasting friendships - can't wait to see what this ride has in store!
