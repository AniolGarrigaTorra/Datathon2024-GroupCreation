For me, this datathon is an opportunity to take my programming skills to the next level. I'm looking to learn new tools, techniques, and methodologies that'll help me grow as a developer and boost my confidence. I'd love to tackle projects that challenge me, work with mentors who can guide me, and be surrounded by like-minded individuals who share my passion for coding. My ultimate goal is to leave this event with a solid understanding of machine learning, data visualization, and more, and feeling empowered to take on new challenges in my junior year. Hi, I'm Ava! I'm a 19-year-old college student diving into the world of programming. I've had a taste of the thrill and excitement of coding, and I'm hooked. I'm looking forward to the datathon as an opportunity to level up my skills and discover new horizons. I'm particularly excited about Machine Learning and AI - the idea of creating something that can think for itself is mind-blowing to me. I'm a bit of a curious cat, always looking to learn new things and take on new challenges. Can't wait to meet like-minded folks and make new connections!
