Honestly, I'm looking to make some amazing memories and connections at this datathon! As a student, I'm always surrounded by books and screens, so I'm excited to be part of a community that shares my passion for data and technology. I want to soak up as much fun as possible, attend all the workshops and events, and make new friends who share my energy and enthusiasm. Winning is not my primary goal - I'm here to learn, grow, and enjoy the ride with a bunch of cool people who are just as stoked as I am! Hey there! I'm Maria Elena, and I'm beyond excited to be part of this datathon. As a student, I'm always fascinated by the intersection of technology and innovation, and I thrive in environments where I can learn, grow, and make connections. I'm all about embracing new experiences and exploring the endless possibilities of AR/VR and enterprise technology. You'll find me attending workshops, jamming with other participants, and soaking up every moment of this unforgettable adventure. My goal? To have an absolute blast and make memories with a crew of like-minded people who are just as stoked as I am!
