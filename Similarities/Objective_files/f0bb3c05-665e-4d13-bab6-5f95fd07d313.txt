My objective for this datathon is to have an awesome time with like-minded people while gaining some valuable experience. I'm more about vibing with my fellow contestants than winning, you know? I want to participate in as many workshops, events, and activities as possible. Meeting new people, exchanging tips, and hearing their stories about their projects is what gets me pumped! I'm all about that datathon camaraderie and energy, and I'm excited to bring that to the table. Let's have fun and make some unforgettable memories, dude! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 21-year-old student looking to dive into the datathon experience. I'm all about vibing with like-minded folks and having an amazing time while gaining valuable experience. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkering with code or exploring new tech trends. I'm stoked to bring my enthusiasm and creativity to the table. For me, this datathon is all about learning from each other, making unforgettable memories, and getting those endorphins pumping! Let's make this a datathon to remember, amped up by the power of community and shared knowledge!
