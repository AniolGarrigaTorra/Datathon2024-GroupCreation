My objective for this datathon is to bring home the win! I'm a competitive person and I thrive under pressure, so I'm going all out to make this the best hackathon experience I've had yet. I'm looking forward to tackling complex challenges, working with a tight-knit team, and pushing myself to deliver a winning solution. I'm not just in it for the glory, though - I also want to prove to myself that I've got what it takes to be a top-notch developer. So, expect to see me intensely focused on problem-solving and code-crafting my way to victory! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a competitive and passionate 20-year-old student who loves a good challenge. I'm currently in my second year of study and looking to put my skills to the test. When it comes to tech, I'm all about solving problems and creating something from scratch. I thrive in high-pressure environments, which makes me a great fit for datathons like this one. I'm ready to dive in, learn from my team, and come out on top. Bring it on!
