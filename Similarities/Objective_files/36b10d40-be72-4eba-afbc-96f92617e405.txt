Winning is what drives me! I've been in eight hackathons, and I've got the itch for that top spot. For this datathon, my ultimate goal is to outsmart the competition and bring home the grand prize. I've studied the challenges and the rules, and I'm ready to put in the long hours to perfect my skills. I'm all about strategy, teamwork, and crushing my opponents - no mercy! The prize may be lucrative, but more importantly, I want that bragging right and the knowledge that I did everything I could to come out on top. Hey there! I'm Astrid Sofia Langen, a 20-year-old coding enthusiast with a hunger for competition. I've spent years honing my programming skills, particularly in IoT and blockchain. I'm fueled by the thrill of building something new and innovative, and I love solving real-world problems. As a third-year student, I've had my fair share of hackathons and I've come to realize that it's not just about the prize - it's about the rush of adrenaline I get from pushing my limits and surpassing expectations. I'm looking forward to bringing that same energy to this datathon and crushing the competition!
