Hi! I'm Anaïs, and for this datathon, my main goal is to soak up the experience and make some awesome memories. I'm all about having a blast, learning something new, and meeting fellow coding enthusiasts. I don't really care about winning - I just want to be part of this exciting adventure! I'll be jumping into challenges, attending workshops, and socializing with fellow participants. Who knows, I might even discover some new interests or skills. At the end of the day, it's all about enjoying the ride and making connections that will last a lifetime! Hey there! I'm Anaïs, an 18-year-old student diving into the datathon universe. I'm stoked to meet fellow coding enthusiasts and learn alongside them. I'm all about embracing the unknown, trying new things, and making unforgettable memories. I'm not too fussed about winning; I'm in this for the ride and the connections that'll come out of it. Expect me to be bouncing around, grabbing snacks, and asking a million questions - all in the name of a blast of a time! Let's make this an adventure to remember!
