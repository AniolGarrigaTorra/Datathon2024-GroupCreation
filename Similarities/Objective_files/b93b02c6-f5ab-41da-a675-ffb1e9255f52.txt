My objective for this datathon is to learn and improve my skills. As a 3rd-year student with limited experience in programming, I want to use this competition as an opportunity to push myself and challenge my abilities. I'm eager to dive deeper into machine learning and data analysis, and gain hands-on experience with new tools and techniques. My goal is to take on new challenges, absorb as much knowledge as possible, and return home with a new set of skills to add to my portfolio. Hey, I'm Leilani! I'm a 3rd-year student with a passion for learning and pushing my boundaries. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming to indie tunes or sipping coffee at a nearby caf√©. With a solid foundation in programming, I'm excited to dive deeper into machine learning and data analysis. As a design geek, I love creating user-friendly interfaces that make life easier. And, of course, I'm all about innovation - I'm fascinated by blockchain's potential to disrupt industries. I'm all about learning, growing, and becoming a better programmer. Can't wait to get started on this datathon!
