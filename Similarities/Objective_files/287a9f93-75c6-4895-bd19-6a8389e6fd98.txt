I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to take my programming skills to the next level. As a freshman in college, I've only had a taste of coding so far, and I'm eager to dive deeper and become more confident in my abilities. I want to work on projects that challenge me, learn new tools and techniques, and get hands-on experience with real-world data. I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and getting feedback from the mentors. My goal is to walk away from this datathon with a new set of skills and a fresh perspective on programming.
