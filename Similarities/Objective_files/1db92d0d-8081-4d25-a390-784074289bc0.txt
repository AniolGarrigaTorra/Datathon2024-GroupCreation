Hey, I'm Ava! As a competitive and driven individual, my objective for this datathon is to give it my all and win. I'm not here to make friends (not that I don't love making new friends, but for this, it's all about the prizes), and I definitely won't be satisfied with just learning new skills - although that's a nice bonus, of course! My goal is to grind hard, brainstorm clever ideas, and outpace the competition. Bring on the challenges, I'm ready to crush them! Hey everyone! I'm Ava, a second-year student with a passion for hacking away at challenges. When I'm not hitting the books, I love diving into tech-related projects that spark my competitive fire. This datathon is all about the thrill of the win and the excitement of pushing my limits. With a curious mind and a willingness to take risks, I'm ready to throw myself into the arena and give it my all. Let's get ready to rumble!
