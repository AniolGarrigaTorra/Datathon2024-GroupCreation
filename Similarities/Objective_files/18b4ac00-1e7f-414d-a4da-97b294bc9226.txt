My goal for this datathon is to dive deeper into data manipulation and visualization. As a junior programmer, I'm eager to challenge myself and learn new skills. I'm hoping to pick up some best practices and techniques from more experienced participants and take away concrete examples to improve my own programming skills. I'm also excited to explore different libraries and tools and see how they can be applied to real-world problems. By the end of the datathon, I aim to have a solid understanding of advanced data analysis and visualization techniques that I can apply to future projects. Hey there! I'm Alessandra, a junior programming enthusiast with a passion for innovative technologies. I'm all about solving problems through code and exploring the intersection of tech and society. As a student, I'm constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve and improve my skills. For this datathon, I'm excited to dive into the world of data analysis and visualization, learn from experienced mentors, and push my skills to the next level. Can't wait to collaborate with fellow participants and see what exciting projects we'll come up with!
