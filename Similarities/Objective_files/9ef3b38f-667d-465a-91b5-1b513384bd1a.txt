My objective for this datathon is simple: to maximize my learning and skill-building experience. I'm all about absorbing new knowledge and challenging myself to level up my programming skills. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I know there's always room for improvement. I'm looking to tackle projects that push me out of my comfort zone, and to learn from others who share my passion for data science. I'm excited to collaborate, brainstorm, and iterate, all while growing as a programmer and a professional. Let's make this datathon count! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien Sophia Lane, a 24-year-old student in my Master's program, and I'm thrilled to be participating in this datathon! I'm all about staying curious and keeping my skills sharp - in programming, I've dabbled in JavaScript, Python, and Flutter, and love pushing myself to learn more. When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in music, art, and social justice initiatives. I'm super excited to challenge myself and grow as a programmer through this datathon, and can't wait to meet the talented folks I'll be collaborating with!
