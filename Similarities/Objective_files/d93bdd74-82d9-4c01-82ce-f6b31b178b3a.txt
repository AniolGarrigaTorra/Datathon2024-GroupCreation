My goal for this datathon is to push my programming skills to the next level and learn from the best. I want to tackle new challenges, experiment with different tools, and develop my problem-solving abilities. I'm not necessarily looking to win first place, but rather take home some valuable experience and knowledge. I'm excited to see what new technologies and approaches are out there and to network with like-minded individuals who share my passion for learning and innovation. Hey there! I'm Alejandro Vicens, a 19-year-old coding enthusiast and student. I'm currently in my 2nd year, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! When I'm not hitting the books, I love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. My goal is to learn as much as I can, take on new challenges, and improve my problem-solving skills. I'm all about innovation and trying new things, whether it's experimenting with AR/VR or discovering new programming languages. I'm ready to dive in, learn, and make some amazing connections!
