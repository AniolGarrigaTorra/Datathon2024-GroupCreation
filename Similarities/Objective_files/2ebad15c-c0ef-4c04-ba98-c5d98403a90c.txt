I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to soak up the vibes, learn from others, and have an absolute blast. I want to join in on as many events and workshops as I can, learn new skills and insights, and make friends with like-minded peeps. I'm more about having fun and making connections than about trying to win (although, I do love a good challenge!). My objective is to leave this datathon feeling refreshed, inspired, and with new friendships to look back on. Bring it on! Hi there! I'm Sara, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. As a university student, I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to learn. I've got a background in programming and love fiddling with coding - whether it's building something new or just solving problems. I'm all about creative solutions and finding innovative ways to get things done. Outside of code, you can find me exploring fintech, blockchain, and cybersecurity. I'm looking forward to meeting other curious and ambitious folks and having an amazing time here at the datathon!
