Hey, I'm all about leveling up my skills! I've been coding for years, but I know there's always room for improvement. For this datathon, I'm really looking to dig deep and learn some new tricks. Whether it's getting familiar with new tech, figuring out some innovative data visualization techniques, or just understanding more about the data itself, I'm all about soaking up knowledge and expanding my toolbox. No specific project in mind, just open to whatever comes my way and sees where the learning takes me! Hey, I'm Marc! I'm a 22-year-old fourth-year student, and coding is my passion. I've spent years honing my programming skills, and I'm always looking for ways to level up. For me, this datathon is an opportunity to explore new technologies, techniques, and data visualization approaches that can enhance my skills. With a background in software development, computer vision, and IoT, I'm excited to dive into a variety of projects and learn as much as I can. Bring on the data, and let's get coding!
