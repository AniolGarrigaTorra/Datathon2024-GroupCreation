My objective for this datathon is to have an amazing time and make lifelong connections! I've participated in six hackathons, and I know how intense they can be. This time around, I'm looking to strike a balance between getting a feel for the competition and soaking up the atmosphere. I want to join in on events, attend seminars, and engage in team-building activities. I'm excited to meet fellow datathon enthusiasts and take part in the fun! I'm not aiming to win; I'm here to learn, laugh, and share my passion for data with others. Hey there! I'm Aurora, a 20-year-old student with a passion for data and technology. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me attending hackathons, coding marathons, or geeking out over new tech trends. I love exploring the intersection of data and health, and I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to apply my skills. At this datathon, I'm hoping to make some amazing connections and memories while soaking up the atmosphere and staying true to myself - no stress about being the best, just pure fun and learning!
