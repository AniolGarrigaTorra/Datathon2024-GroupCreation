Here's my objective:

I'm all about crushing it and taking home that win. As a beginner in the world of coding, I want to take advantage of this datathon to show what I've got and see how far I can push myself. I'm excited to tackle challenges head-on and use my problem-solving skills to overcome any obstacles. My goal is to outdo myself and surprise everyone with my progress - it's going to be a tough competition, but I'm ready for the challenge! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a first-year student with a passion for learning and problem-solving. I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon, where I can flex my coding muscles and push myself to the limit. As a beginner, I'm eager to apply my UI/UX skills to real-world problems and see how far I can go. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over life hacks or exploring the world of blockchain and quantum mechanics. I'm ready to take on this challenge and surprise everyone with my progress - let's get started!
