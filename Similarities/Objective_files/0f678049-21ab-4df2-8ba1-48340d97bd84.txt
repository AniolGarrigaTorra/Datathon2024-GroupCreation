Hey there! I'm Llorenç, and my objective for this datathon is to have a blast and meet some amazing people! As a student, I've had limited opportunities to network and collaborate with like-minded individuals, so I'm super excited to finally connect with fellow coders and data enthusiasts. I'm not as much about winning or trying to be the best (although I do love a good challenge!), I'm more about creating lifelong friendships and having a kick-butt time. Let's make some unforgettable memories, shall we? Hey there! I'm Llorenç, and I'm beyond stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm a third-year student looking to level up my coding game and meet fellow coding enthusiasts. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me experimenting with new programming languages, designing prototypes on Figma, or geeking out over the latest blockchain innovations. Above all, I'm all about collaboration and lifelong connections. Can't wait to bond with my teammates, create something amazing together, and make some unforgettable memories along the way. Let's do this!
