Hey! As Sofia Elisa Garc√≠a, my main goal for this datathon is to focus on learning new things and improving my skills. I'm just in my second year of studying, and I'm eager to learn as much as I can. I'm not looking to win or focus solely on the competition aspect, but rather to absorb knowledge from industry experts, learn from others, and develop my problem-solving skills. I want to leave this datathon feeling inspired, motivated, and confident that I can tackle more complex projects. Wish me luck! Hi everyone, I'm Sofia! I'm a second-year student with a passion for learning and experimenting with new technologies. I'm all about bridging the gap between art and technology, and I'm super excited to see where this datathon takes me. My goal is to soak up as much knowledge as possible, learn from my peers, and develop my problem-solving skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, creating digital art, or exploring AR/VR possibilities. I'm all about continuous growth, and this datathon feels like the perfect opportunity to take my skills to the next level!
