My objective for this datathon is to create unforgettable memories and build lasting connections with fellow participants. I'm all about fostering meaningful relationships and having a blast while exploring the world of data. I want to participate in as many events as I can, from workshops to game shows, and make sure I take part in some awesome team-building activities. By doing so, I aim to expand my social circle and learn from others while sharing my own enthusiasm for data and tech. Let's have some fun and make this an experience to remember! Hey everyone! I'm Alessandra, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon. As a 2nd-year student, I'm always up for a challenge and learning from others. I've had a knack for programming and design, with a passion for creative expression. My friends would say I'm a people person, always looking for ways to connect with others and make memories. For this datathon, I'm all about embracing my love for data and making it a blast. Get ready for good vibes, shared laughter, and some awesome team-building fun! Let's make this an unforgettable experience!
