Hi! I'm Léonora. For this datathon, I'm all about vibes, man. I want to make some new friends, have a blast, and participate in as many events as I can. I'm not about competing or winning (not that I wouldn't love to though!). I'm all about learning, laughter, and networking. My objective is to immerse myself in the datathon experience, learn new tricks, and get to know fellow data enthusiasts. I'm excited to make memories, share experiences, and discover hidden gems within the community! Hey there! I'm Léonora, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! I'm a 2nd-year student with a passion for learning and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. I'm all about fostering an environment that's chill, collaborative, and empowering. When I'm not coding or brainstorming, you can find me geeking out over graphic design or geeking out (yes, it's a thing) over fintech trends. My goal for this datathon is to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, learn from their experiences, and contribute to the community in a positive way. See you around!
