I'm all about continuous learning and skill-building. For this datathon, my objective is to challenge myself and improve my data analytics skills. I want to dive deeper into new tools and techniques, stay up-to-date with industry trends, and develop my ability to effectively solve complex problems. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow participants, learn from their experiences, and take away actionable knowledge to enhance my skills. I'm looking forward to being fully immersed in the datathon process and coming away with a newfound confidence in my abilities. Hey everyone! I'm Sof√≠a, a 20-year-old student with a passion for continuous learning and personal growth. I've had experience in programming, and I'm excited to take on new challenges at this datathon.
