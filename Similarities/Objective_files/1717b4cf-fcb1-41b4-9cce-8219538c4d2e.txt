Here's my objective for the datathon:

As a competitive spirit at heart, my ultimate goal is to win the datathon! I'm ready to pour my heart and soul into cracking those problems, refining my coding skills, and pushing myself to the limit. I aim to work seamlessly with my teammates, leveraging our collective strengths and knowledge to deliver top-notch solutions. My goal is to bring home that coveted 1st place prize and prove to myself that my skills can really make a difference. Hi there! I'm Soledad, a 20-year-old student with a passion for building innovative solutions. With an intermediate level of programming experience, I'm excited to put my skills to the test in this datathon. My fascination with Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and Databases drives me to solve complex problems. As a competitive spirit, I thrive under pressure and love the thrill of competition. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new designs in Figma. I'm eager to meet my new teammates and work together to achieve our goals!
