Hey, I'm Alessia! I'm here to crush it and bring home that trophy! My objective for this datathon is to compete with all my might and do everything I can to win. I've participated in three hackathons before and I've come close to winning once, so I'm ready to step up my game and show what I'm capable of. I'll pour all my energy into solving this challenge and I'm willing to learn whatever I need to in order to come out on top. Bring on the data, I'm ready to take it on! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 20-year-old third-year student, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! I've been involved in three hackathons before and I'm determined to bring home that trophy. I thrive in fast-paced environments and I'm a firm believer that with passion and persistence, you can accomplish anything. My tech background has allowed me to experiment with various coding languages and tools, but I'm always looking to grow and learn more. I'm all about pushing boundaries, thinking outside the box, and making the most out of any opportunity.
