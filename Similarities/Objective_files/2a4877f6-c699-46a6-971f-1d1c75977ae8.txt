Hey! So, my goal for this datathon is to chill out and have a blast with fellow coders. I'm all about making new friends and networking, but without the intense competition vibes. I want to participate in as many cool events as possible, attend some awesome workshops, and just soak up all the datathon energy! I'll definitely be tackling some problems, but more for fun and to learn from others, rather than trying to win. So, if you're up for a laid-back datathon experience, let's grab some coffee (or a snack) and have a great time together! Hey there! I'm Eva Sophia, a 21-year-old student who's all about chill vibes and new connections. I'm in my third year, and I'm more about making friends and learning from others than competing. When I'm not coding, you can catch me jamming out to music or flipping through art books. I'm looking forward to an epic datathon experience, jamming out with fellow coders, and sipping on some amazing coffee. It's time to take it easy, make some memories, and level up my skills - let's do this!
