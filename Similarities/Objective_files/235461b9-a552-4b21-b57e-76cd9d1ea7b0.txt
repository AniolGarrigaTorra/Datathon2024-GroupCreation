My goal is to crush it and take home that winning title! I've been hooked on competitive hackathons since I joined my first one last year and I'm hooked on the thrill of solving problems under pressure. I'm all about strategy, efficiency, and innovation. I'm gonna throw myself headfirst into the tasks, collaborate with teammates who share my vibe, and give it my all to make it to the top. Bring on the challenge, I'm ready to prove myself and reap the rewards! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a 21-year-old coding enthusiast with a passion for creative problem-solving. I'm in my fourth year of studying, and I've been hooked on competitive hackathons since my first one last year. I thrive under pressure, and I love collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring innovative ideas to life. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over AR/VR or working on design projects to bring my ideas to life. I'm all about efficiency, innovation, and having fun - and I'm ready to crush it at this datathon! Bring on the challenge!
