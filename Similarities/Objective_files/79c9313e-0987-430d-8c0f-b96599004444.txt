My objective? To bring home the gold! I'm dead set on winning this datathon. I've been practicing my coding skills nonstop and I'm feeling pretty confident about my abilities. I've participated in one hackathon before and learned a thing or two, but I know this competition will be way tougher. I'm ready to put in the long hours and make the necessary sacrifices to come out on top. I'm looking forward to the adrenaline rush of the competition and the satisfaction of crossing that finish line first. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Alessia Wyndham, a 17-year-old coding enthusiast and first-year student. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me honing my programming skills or jamming to my favorite tunes. I'm a bit of a competitive nerd, and that's why I'm stoked to be here for the datathon. I've got my sights set on the top prize, and I'm willing to put in the hard work to get there. I'm excited to challenge myself, learn from others, and create something amazing alongside some incredible minds. It's going to be a wild ride, and I'm ready to bring my A-game!
