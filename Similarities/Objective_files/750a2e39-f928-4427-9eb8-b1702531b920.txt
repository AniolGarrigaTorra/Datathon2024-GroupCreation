For this datathon, my objective is simple: to hang loose and have a blast! I'm all about soaking up the experience, meeting fellow datathon enthusiasts, and jamming with fellow coders. I'm not about the intense competition - I want to take a step back, learn from others, and just enjoy the ride. I'm stoked to participate in as many events as possible, from workshops to parties, and make unforgettable memories with fellow participants. Bring on the data, but more importantly, bring on the good vibes! Hey there! I'm Nina, a 20-year-old student soaking up knowledge like a sponge. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me catching up on the latest gaming or mobile trends, exploring AR/VR experiences, or jamming out to sick tunes. As I approach my 3rd year of studying, I'm all about leveling up my skills and meeting fellow data enthusiasts who share my passion for adventure. Datathon vibes, workshops, and parties - bring it on! I'm stoked to kickstart this wild ride, absorb fresh knowledge, and forge unforgettable memories with you all. Let's keep it chill, fun, and all about good vibes!
