Hey! My objective for this datathon is to give it my all and come out on top. I've been preparing for weeks, honing my skills and building my projects. I'm confident in my abilities and I'm ready to push myself to the limit to get that first prize. I'm looking to challenge myself and prove that I'm one of the best. I'm competitive, focused, and driven - bring it on! Hey there! I'm Viviane, an 18-year-old coding enthusiast. I'm in my second year of studies, and I've been hooked on programming since day one. I thrive under pressure, and that's why I'm determined to crush it at this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm probably exploring new ways to optimize my daily routine or crafting innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm all about leveling up my skills and learning from others. This datathon is my chance to prove myself, and I'm ready to give it my all!
