I'm so stoked to be a part of this datathon! My goal isn't to come out on top or even get a medal, but to make the most of this experience. I want to meet fellow data enthusiasts, learn new things, and just have an awesome time. I'm looking forward to attending workshops, networking with other participants, and taking part in challenges and events. If I happen to learn something new or get inspiration for my own projects, that's a bonus! But honestly, my main objective is to make unforgettable memories and walk away with a bunch of cool new friends. Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a 20-year-old student in my third year, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm all about combining technology with my passion for making a positive impact. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me coding away or diving into new industries like health and education. My goal for this datathon is simple: I want to learn from others, share my own experiences, and create some unforgettable memories along the way. I'm looking forward to meeting you all and seeing what this datathon has in store for us!
