Here's my objective:

I'm looking to use this datathon as an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and have a blast with like-minded folks! I want to immerse myself in the datathon atmosphere, attend as many events as possible, and make some new friends along the way. Whether it's participating in workshops, jamming on puzzles, or hanging out with teammates, I want to soak up every bit of fun and camaraderie this event has to offer. Bring on the socialising, I'm ready to connect and create some unforgettable memories! Hi! I'm Ariadna, a 20-year-old student with a passion for coding and socializing. I've been tinkering with programming languages and technologies, trying to master new skills every day. Outside of coding, I love connecting with people and fostering a sense of community. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, hoping to have an amazing time with like-minded folks. My goal is to step out of my comfort zone, learn from others, and create unforgettable memories!
