I'm super excited to participate in this datathon and take my skills to the next level. I'm not aiming to be the top winner or make a super-competitive effort, but instead, I want to learn as much as I can from this experience. I'm hoping to improve my programming skills, learn new tools and techniques, and maybe even explore new areas of interest. My objective is to be in the right mindset to soak up knowledge and inspiration from the other participants, mentors, and events. Can't wait to see what I can accomplish! Hey! I'm Sofia, a third-year student and coding enthusiast. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon, where I hope to take my skills to new heights. With a background in programming, I'm curious about the possibilities of voice skills and immersive experiences, and love combining technology with art and music. For this datathon, I'm aiming to learn, be inspired, and soak up knowledge from the amazing lineup of events and experts. Let's have some fun and see what cool stuff we can create together!
