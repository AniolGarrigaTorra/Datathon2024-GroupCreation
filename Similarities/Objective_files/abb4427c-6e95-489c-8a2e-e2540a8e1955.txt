Hey there! I'm Aurora, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! For me, it's all about vibing with fellow data enthusiasts and making some amazing memories. I'm not here to compete or get too serious - I just want to have a blast and take in as much as I can. I'll be focusing on participating in as many events as possible, from workshops to talks, and of course, the fun networking bits in between. Let's build some data-friends and create some unforgettable moments together! Hey everyone! I'm Aurora, a third-year student with a passion for all things data.

When I'm not in class, you can find me geeking out over quantum theories or experimenting with AR/VR technology. I'm all about having a blast and taking in as much as I can, so let's build some data-friends and create some magic together! Ready to learn, network, and have a good time?
