Hey there! So, I'm Céline and I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon! My goal for the weekend is to have a blast with fellow data enthusiasts. I'm all about making new friends and connections in the community. I want to immerse myself in the atmosphere, attend as many sessions and workshops as possible, and enjoy the creative problem-solving vibe with my new buddies. If I happen to snag a awesome project idea or learn something new, that's just the icing on the cake for me! Let's make this weekend unforgettable, friends! Hey there! I'm Céline, a 20-year-old student who's all about embracing the fusion of tech and creativity. I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon, where I hope to dive into a whirlpool of innovative ideas and connect with like-minded folk. When I'm not studying, I'm tinkering with the latest gadgets or pouring my heart into art and music. I'm super curious about what this weekend has in store, and I'm excited to co-create some awesomeness with the squad!
