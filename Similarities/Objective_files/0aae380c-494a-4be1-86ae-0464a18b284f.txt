My objective for this datathon is straightforward: I want to dive headfirst into the world of data and come out with new skills and a better understanding of the concepts. I'm not too concerned with winning or competing - although a prize or two wouldn't hurt, I'm all about personal growth and development. I hope to learn as much as possible from my fellow participants, mentors, and resources, and take that knowledge back to my university coursework to improve my skills. Ultimately, I want to leave here a better programmer and data analyst than I was when I arrived. Hey there! I'm Pau, a 20-year-old student with a passion for programming. I'm entering this datathon with a sense of adventure and a desire to learn more about the world of data. My experience with Agile Methodology and Android Development has given me a solid foundation, and I'm excited to dive into new skills. In my free time, I love playing games and exploring the latest mobile tech. For me, this datathon is all about personal growth and development. I'm looking forward to collaborating with others, absorbing new knowledge, and returning to my studies with fresh skills.
