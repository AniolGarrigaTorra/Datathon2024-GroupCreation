As Ashley Emily Wynter, my goal for this datathon is to make the most of this amazing experience. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, bonding over our shared passion for data and technology, and having an absolute blast! I want to participate in as many events and activities as possible, from workshops to speed dating sessions, and soak up every ounce of knowledge and fun I can get. For me, it's all about making lasting connections and creating memories that will keep me smiling long after the datathon is over. Hey! I'm Ashley Emily Wynter, a second-year student with a passion for making technology a force for good. I'm stoked to be here for the datathon and can't wait to dive into the exciting challenges and learn from like-minded people. I've got a bit of experience in programming, which has opened doors to exploring topics like IoT and Cybersecurity. When I'm not busy with academics, you can find me tinkering with projects that combine tech and social impact. I'm all about collaboration, innovation, and fun, so let's get this party started!
