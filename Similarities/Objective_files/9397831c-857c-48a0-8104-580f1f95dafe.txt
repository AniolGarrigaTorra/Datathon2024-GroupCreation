My objective is clear: I'm here to win! With my beginner programming skills, I'm eager to put my coding abilities to the test and take home the top prize. I've participated in a couple of hackathons and learned a thing or two, but I'm not satisfied with just surviving - I want to conquer this datathon and be recognized as one of the top competitors. I'm ready to put in the long hours, stay focused, and push myself to the limit to come out on top. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Lidia Schnell, a 17-year-old first-year student with a passion for solving real-world problems through coding. With a couple of hackathons under my belt, I've learned to thrive under pressure and am always looking to improve. I'm excited to bring my beginner-level programming skills to this datathon, where I hope to push myself to the limit and come out on top. When I'm not coding, you can find me researching innovative tech trends or experimenting with new lifehacks to make my daily life more efficient.
