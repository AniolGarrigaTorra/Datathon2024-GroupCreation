My objective for this datathon is to come out a better coder and a smarter problem-solver. I'm looking forward to digging into new data sets, learning new tools and techniques, and leveling up my skills. I'm excited to tackle challenging problems and work alongside fellow enthusiasts to push my boundaries. I hope to walk away from this datathon with new tricks up my sleeve, a sense of accomplishment, and a refreshed perspective on the world of data analysis. And, of course, meet some cool people along the way - but that's just a bonus! Hey! I'm Luna RÃ©ne, a 20-year-old student on a mission to level up my coding skills.
