My objective for this datathon is to bring home the trophy! I'm a competitive bug by nature, and I thrive under pressure. I've participated in four hackathons before, and I'm convinced that with enough caffeine, coding, and collaboration, I can take home the top prize. I'm looking forward to the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of tackling complex challenges head-on. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien Langdon, a 21-year-old student with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. When I'm not hitting the books, I love staying on the bleeding edge of tech, whether it's digging into the latest blockchains or experimenting with AR/VR. I've had a taste of competitive coding through hackathons and am hooked - the rush of adrenaline and thrill of overcoming challenges is unparalleled. I'm looking to bring home the trophy this time around and am ready to put my skills to the test.
