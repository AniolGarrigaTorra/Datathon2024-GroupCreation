Hey! As a 19-year-old sophomore, I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My objective is to focus on learning new things and improving my skills. I've had a decent experience with programming, but I want to take my Intermediate skills to the next level. I'm looking forward to diving into real-world projects, exploring new technologies, and learning from the amazing mentors and organizers. I'd love to learn how to apply theoretical concepts to solve actual problems, and hopefully walk away with some impressive projects to showcase! Wish me luck, and let's make some datathon magic happen! Hey there! I'm Avery Wellesley, a 19-year-old sophomore looking to level up my programming skills.
