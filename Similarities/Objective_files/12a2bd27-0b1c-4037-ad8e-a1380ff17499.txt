For this datathon, I'm looking to maximize my social skills and make some amazing friends! As a beginner in programming, I'm all about learning and growing, but at the same time, I want to have an absolute blast! My objective is to participate in as many events and activities as possible, network with fellow datathoners, and soak up the energetic atmosphere. I'm excited to share stories, laughs, and experiences with like-minded people, and come out of this feeling more connected and inspired. See you at the datathon! Hey there! I'm Sofia Rodríguez-Martínez, a 17-year-old student eager to dive into the datathon excitement! As a beginner in programming, I'm all about learning and growth. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology, and I'm looking forward to exploring that further at the datathon. My goal is to make the most of this experience by attending as many events as possible, meeting fellow datathoners, and creating unforgettable memories. I'm a people person, and I thrive in social settings, so let's do this!
