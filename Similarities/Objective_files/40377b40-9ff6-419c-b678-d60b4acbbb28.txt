I'm all about giving it my all and taking the competition by storm! As a relatively experienced hackathon participant, I'm hungry for a win and I know my coding skills are top-notch. I'm here to learn from the other participants, but my main goal is to take the top spot. I'll pour all my energy into this datathon, dedicating myself fully to building an innovative solution that truly stands out. I want to walk away with the trophy and the satisfaction of a hard-won victory. Nothing less will do for me! Hey there! I'm Alicia SÃ¡nchez, a third-year student with a passion for problem-solving and a drive to innovate. I've been honing my coding skills for a few years now, and I'm excited to bring my expertise to this datathon. With a background in communication and interests in tech trends like IoT and AR/VR, I'm always looking for ways to combine creativity and tech to make a real difference. I'm in it to win it, and I'm confident that my skills and enthusiasm will set me apart from the competition. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and see what amazing projects we can create!
