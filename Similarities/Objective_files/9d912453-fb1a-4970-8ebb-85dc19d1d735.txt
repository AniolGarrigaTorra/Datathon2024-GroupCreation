My objective for this datathon is straightforward - I'm here to win. As a student and novice programmer, I've had success in smaller hackathons, but I want to prove myself at this bigger competition. I've been studying data structures and algorithms intensively and I'm confident in my coding skills. I'm willing to put in the long hours and adapt to any changes to come out on top. I'm driven by a desire to learn from the best, get recognition for my work, and maybe even land an internship or job opportunity as a result of my performance. Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 20-year-old student determined to make a splash at this datathon. I've always been passionate about creating positive impact and I'm excited to bring my passion to the competition. As a 3rd-year student, I've had some taste of coding through smaller projects and I'm feeling more confident in my skills than ever. I'm eager to tackle big data challenges and learn from the best. Let's do this!
