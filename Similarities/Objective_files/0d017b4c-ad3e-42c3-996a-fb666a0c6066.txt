My objective is to make the most of this datathon experience! I'm all about having a blast, meeting new people, and participating in as many events as I can. I'm excited to share laughs and learning moments with fellow datathon-goers. While I might not be a coding guru, I promise to bring an open and enthusiastic attitude to the table. My goal is to come out of this weekend with a renewed sense of purpose and some awesome new contacts - and maybe even a few amazing memes to share on social media afterwards Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 21-year-old student, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! As a programming newbie-turned-enthusiast, I'm all about making connections and having a blast with fellow data lovers. I'm passionate about exploring cutting-edge tech like quantum and fintech, and I'm always eager to learn more about the world of databases. My goal for this weekend is to soak up knowledge, share laughs, and maybe even stumble upon a new hidden talent. I'm all about keeping it fun and light-hearted, so expect to see me grinning from ear to ear and ready to tackle whatever comes our way!
