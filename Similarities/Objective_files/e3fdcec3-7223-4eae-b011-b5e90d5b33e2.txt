Here's my objective for the datathon: Hey, I'm all about making the most of this datathon experience! My goal is to have an absolute blast, meet new people who share similar passions, and take part in as many events as I can. Whether it's trying out new tools, attending workshops, or simply hanging out in the community area, I want to soak up every moment and make lifelong connections with fellow datathon enthusiasts. Let's rock this! Hey! I'm Aur√©lie, a third-year student on a mission to have the ultimate datathon experience! I'm stoked to be here, sharing adventures with fellow coding enthusiasts. My passion lies at the intersection of innovation, education, and tech. When I'm not busy coding away, you can find me exploring mobile app development or experimenting with data analysis. I'm excited to level up my skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Can't wait to geek out, make new friends, and learn from the best!
