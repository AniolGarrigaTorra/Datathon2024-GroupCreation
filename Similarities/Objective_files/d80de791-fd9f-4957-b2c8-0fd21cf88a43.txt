My objective for this datathon is to crush it and bring home that trophy! I'm all about competing at the highest level and trying my best to emerge victorious. I've got my sights set on the top prize, and I'm willing to put in the work to get there. I'll be focusing on mastering the challenges and pushing myself to learn as much as I can about data analysis and programming. My strategy is simple: learn, adapt, and dominate. Watch out for me, I'm going all in to take home that win! Hey there! I'm Emmanuelle Corb√®s, a 19-year-old student looking to make a name for myself in the datathon. As a beginner in programming, I'm eager to put my skills to the test and show what I'm capable of. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to music or exploring the latest art trends. I'm all about using my passion for tech to make a positive impact, and I'm excited to see where this datathon takes me.
