Hey there! I'm Aleixandra, and for this datathon, my goal is to have a blast, meet some amazing people, and soak up as much goodness as possible. I'm not trying to win or brag about my skills - I just want to have fun, learn new things, and be part of a dynamic community. I'm all about making connections, attending events, and trying out cool projects. I'd love to hang out with my new friends, share some laughs, and see where the datathon takes us. That sounds like an awesome adventure to me! Hey, I'm Aleixandra! A 20-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I love exploring cutting-edge tech, like RPA and DevOps, and discovering new ways to automate tasks and streamline workflows. When I'm not in class, you can find me tinkering with web development or learning something new in the realm of IoT. I'm all about making connections, attending events, and trying out cool projects. I'm excited to meet like-minded people and have some fun, no expectations, no ego - just a blast!
