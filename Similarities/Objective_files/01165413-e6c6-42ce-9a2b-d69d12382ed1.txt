Hey! So, my objective for this datathon is to dive deep and learn as much as I can. As a second-year student, I'm looking to gain some serious hands-on experience and level up my programming skills. I've been in one hackathon before, and while I had a blast, I want to use this event to really focus on improving my skills and knowledge. I'm excited to be surrounded by other coders and experts, and I'm looking forward to absorbing as much as I can from the workshops and challenges. Let's get coding and learn together! Hey there! I'm Luna Elisabeth Kramer, an 18-year-old computer science student in my second year. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon and can't wait to dive deep into some awesome projects. With a background in coding, I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills. I've had a taste of hackathons before, and I'm now looking to refine my programming chops and make meaningful connections with like-minded individuals. Let's get this coding party started!
