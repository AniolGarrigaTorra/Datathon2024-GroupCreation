My objective for this datathon is to dive deeper into learning and improving my programming skills. As a third-year student, I've gotten comfortable with the basics, but I know there's so much more to explore. I'm excited to immerse myself in this new challenge and develop a specific skillset. I'd love to learn new libraries, programming languages, or techniques to enhance my coding abilities. I'm also hoping to make meaningful connections with fellow participants and mentors who can share their expertise and insights. My ultimate goal is to leave this datathon with a newfound confidence in my abilities and a fresh perspective on problem-solving. Hey, I'm Sofia!
