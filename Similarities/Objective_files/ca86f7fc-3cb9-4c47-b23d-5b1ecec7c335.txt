Hey! My objective for this datathon is clear: I'm here to win. I've had some experience with programming and want to put it to the test. I'm all about pushing myself to the limit and getting the best possible results. I've learned so much from my previous hackathon experience, and I'm pumped to bring that momentum into this competition. I'm all about beating the clock and my fellow competitors to claim that top spot. Expect to see me scribbling codes all night and living off coffee till we reach the finish line! Hey there! I'm Emilie, a 2nd-year student with a thirst for excitement and a passion for coding. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm diving headfirst into projects that push the boundaries of tech. My previous hackathon experiences have given me the skills to get ahead, and now I'm here to test my limits and see how far I can take my coding journey. When the clock starts ticking, I'm all in, fueled by caffeine and determination to take the top spot. I'm stoked to be here, and can't wait to see what this datathon has in store!
