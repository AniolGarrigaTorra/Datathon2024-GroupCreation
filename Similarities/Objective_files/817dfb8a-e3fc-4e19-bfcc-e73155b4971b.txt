My goal for this datathon is to level up my skills! I'm looking forward to diving into new technologies and learning from the amazing people here. I'd love to improve my understanding of data analysis and visualization, and gain experience with new tools and languages. For me, it's all about personal growth and developing a stronger skillset. I'm hoping to take away some valuable takeaways and maybe even work on a project that solves a real-world problem. I'm excited to challenge myself and come away from this with new knowledge and expertise! Hey everyone! I'm Marina, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon! As a 2nd-year student, I'm always looking to level up my skills and learn from the best. My interests lie in solving real-world problems, and I think this event is the perfect opportunity to do so. I've got a passion for lifehacks and education, and I believe technology can be a powerful tool to achieve both. I'm excited to work alongside such talented individuals and take away valuable lessons to help me grow both personally and professionally. Let's do this!
