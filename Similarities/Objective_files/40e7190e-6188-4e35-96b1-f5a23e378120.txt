I'm in it to win it! As a competitive coding nerd, my goal for this datathon is to push myself to the limit and emerge victorious. I've got my eyes on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the hard work to get there. I'm excited to tackle the challenge and see how my skills measure up against others. Bring on the data, bring on the algorithms, and bring on the competition - I'm ready to take it on! Hey there! I'm Marina, a third-year student with a passion for code and a competitive streak. When I'm not studying, I love diving into the world of AR/VR and cybersecurity. My friends would describe me as a nerd-turned-fanatic for all things data-driven. I'm excited to bring my intermediate-level programming skills to the datathon and push myself to the limit. My mantra? The limit is the line that separates learning from growth. Bring on the data!
