Hey there! So, my objective for this datathon is pretty straightforward: I want to improve my skills and take my programming skills to the next level. I've participated in a few hackathons already, and I've learned a ton, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm excited to work with a new set of tools and teammates to challenge myself and expand my horizons. I'm all about continuous learning, and this datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to do just that. Hi everyone! I'm Aurora Isabella, a 2nd-year student excited to be part of this datathon. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me geeking out over cutting-edge tech. I've dabbled in programming and have a thirst for knowledge that's only been quenched by participating in a few hackathons so far. I'm all about lifelong learning and love exploring the intersections of education, innovation, and entrepreneurship. I'm stoked to be here, ready to stretch my programming muscles, and collaborate with an amazing team to create something awesome!
