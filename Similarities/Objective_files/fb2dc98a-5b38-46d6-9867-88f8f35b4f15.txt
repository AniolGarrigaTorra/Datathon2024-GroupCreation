I'm in this datathon to crush it and take home that top prize. My goal is to pour my heart and soul into crafting a solution that showcases my skills and stands out from the crowd. I'll be fully focused on optimizing my code, iterating rapidly, and staying ahead of the game. Winning isn't just about beating the others, it's about proving to myself that I have what it takes to be the best. No compromises, no distractions - just pure, unadulterated competitive energy! Hi there! I'm Aur√©lie Langley, a passionate PhD student by day and competitive coding enthusiast by night. I'm all about pushing boundaries and testing my limits. When I'm not crunching numbers or designing interfaces, you can find me brainstorming ways to make education more accessible and effective. I thrive under pressure and am fueled by the thrill of the chase. My goal in this datathon is to unleash my full potential and create something remarkable. I'm all in, and ready to give it my best shot! Let's do this!
