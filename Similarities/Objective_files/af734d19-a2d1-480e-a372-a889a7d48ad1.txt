Hi! As a participant, my main objective is to bring home the gold! I'm super competitive, and the idea of winning is what gets me pumped. I've studied all the challenges and themes, and I'm confident in my abilities to execute a top-notch project. I'll be dedicating all my time and energy to research, coding, and refining my concept to ensure it stands out. I'm aiming for a perfect score, and I'm willing to put in the hard work required to achieve it. My goal is to take home that winning title and show everyone what I'm capable of! Hey there! I'm Madeleine, and I'm super excited to be participating in this datathon. I'm a first-year student with a passion for problem-solving and a thirst for competition. I've always been drawn to the intersection of tech and society, and I'm excited to see how our projects can positively impact the world. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or experimenting with new lifehacks. I'm all about efficiency and innovation, and I'm looking forward to learning from the best and making new friends. Bring it on!
