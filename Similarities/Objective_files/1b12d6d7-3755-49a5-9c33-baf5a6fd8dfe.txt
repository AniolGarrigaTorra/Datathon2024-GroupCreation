My goal for this datathon is to soak up the atmosphere and make some awesome new friends! I've competed in a few hackathons before, but this time, I want to take it easy, have fun, and be a part of as many events as possible. I'm excited to learn new things and get inspired by the others, but for now, let's just say I'm focusing on creating memories and making it an unforgettable experience! Hey! I'm Núria Sònia Bassa, a 20-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. I've been coding since I was a teenager, and now I'm in my third year, diving deep into all sorts of programs and technologies. My friends would describe me as a bit of a creativity nerd - I love combining tech with art, music, and design to make something truly unique. When I'm not stuck in front of a screen, you can find me spinning DJ sets or hiking in the mountains. I'm stoked to be here at the datathon, and I'm looking forward to making some amazing memories!
