For me, this datathon is an opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer. I've had some exposure to coding through online tutorials and participating in a few hackathons, but I know there's still so much to discover. My objective is to dive deeper into data analytics and machine learning, and to improve my skills in programming languages like Python and R. I'm excited to collaborate with others, attend workshops, and explore new tools and technologies. I hope to come out of this datathon with a better understanding of the field and new ideas to apply in my studies and future projects. Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, an 18-year-old student diving into the world of programming. I've had a taste of coding through online tutorials and hackathons, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm super stoked to be here, hoping to grow my skills and make new connections. I'm curious about how data can drive positive change, and I'm excited to learn more about machine learning and AI. Outside of coding, I'm a fan of finding innovative solutions to everyday problems, and I love exploring new tech and tools. Let's collaborate and learn together!
