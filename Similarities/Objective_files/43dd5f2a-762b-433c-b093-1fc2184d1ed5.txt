Hi! My objective for this datathon is to soak up the vibe and make the most of this awesome experience. I'm all about meeting new people, having a blast, and diving into all the cool events they've got planned. I don't feel the need to stress about winning - my goal is to learn as much as I can in a chill, fun environment. I'm excited to geek out with fellow enthusiasts, grab lunch with some new friends, and get my adrenaline pumping during the hack-a-thons. Let's make some unforgettable memories, datathon style! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 2nd-year student with a passion for learning and exploring new tech. I'm all about diving into new worlds and finding ways to make them more awesome. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon and soak up the energy. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me geeking out over e-commerce innovations or debating the future of blockchain. My approach is laid-back, and I'm all about having fun while making the most of this incredible experience. Can't wait to meet everyone and make some unforgettable memories!
