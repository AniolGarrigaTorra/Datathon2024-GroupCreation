I'm all about making the most of this datathon experience! I'm not necessarily here to compete or come out on top, but rather to soak up all the fun and excitement that comes with it. I'm hoping to connect with fellow participants, learn about new technologies and techniques, and of course, attend as many workshops, talks, and events as possible. My goal is to leave with a whole new network of friends, a ton of useful knowledge, and maybe even a few memorable stories to share! Hey everyone! I'm Livia, a curious and artistic 18-year-old student diving into my second year of university. I'm stoked to be part of this datathon, not just to win, but to learn and connect with all the amazing people here. I'm all about creativity, problem-solving, and making things happen - and I think this datathon will be an incredible opportunity to tap into all those passions! Can't wait to get lost in the hustle and bustle, learn something new, and make some unforgettable memories!
