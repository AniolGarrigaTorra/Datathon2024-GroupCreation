Hey, I'm Lara! I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon. My main goal is to learn new techniques and improve my programming skills. I'm an intermediate programmer and I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I always feel like there's more to learn and new challenges to take on. During this datathon, I'm hoping to dive deeper into specific areas, like data analysis and machine learning, and learn from others who are experts in those fields. I'm looking forward to getting hands-on experience and taking away new knowledge that I can apply in my future projects. Hi everyone! I'm Lara, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon. I'm a third-year student with a knack for programming and a passion for learning. When I'm not buried in textbooks, I love diving into the world of e-commerce and cybersecurity - there's something about the intersection of tech and business that really gets me going. I've been involved in a few hackathons before, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level. Can't wait to learn, create, and make new friends over the next few days!
