My objective for this datathon is to have an amazing time with fellow participants! I want to dive head-first into all the fun activities, workshops, and events, and make the most of this experience. I'm excited to meet new people and learn from each other's perspectives, but more than that, I'm hoping to make some new friends. Let's say, 10 or 15 solid connections! I'm looking forward to laughing, sharing stories, and making unforgettable memories. Bring on the datathon! Hi! I'm Eva RÃ­os Morales, a first-year student and excited participant in this datathon! I'm 17, and I'm thrilled to be surrounded by like-minded individuals who share my passion for innovation and making a difference. Outside of class, I love exploring the latest in tech and finding creative solutions to real-world problems. I'm all about embracing new experiences, meeting new people, and having an absolute blast!
