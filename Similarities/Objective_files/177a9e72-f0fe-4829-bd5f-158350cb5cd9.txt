My ultimate objective for this datathon is to bring home that coveted first place win! I've been hooked on competitive coding since my first hackathon and I'm ready to push myself to the limits to come out on top. I'll be diving headfirst into every challenge, pouring over every bug and optimization to ensure my solution is the best it can be. I'm not here to make friends or learn new tricks, my focus is solely on the prize and I won't rest until I've got it in my grasp. Bring on the competition! Hi, I'm Vilmarita Esteban Moreno. I'm a 20-year-old student with a competitive streak a mile wide. I've been hooked on hackathons since my first one, and I'm not looking to slow down anytime soon. My passion is solving problems, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges that test my skills. As a student, I'm always learning and improving my skills, but I'm ready to put that to the test and compete at the highest level. Expect me to dive deep into every challenge and give it my all - no distractions, no distractions, just raw determination to win.
