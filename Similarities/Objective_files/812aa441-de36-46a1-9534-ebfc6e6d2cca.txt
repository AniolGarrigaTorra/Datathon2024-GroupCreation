My objective for this datathon is all about having a blast! I'm not worried about winning or pushing myself to be the best, I just want to enjoy the experience and make new connections. I'd love to attend every workshop and event I can, try out different tools and techs, and meet fellow participants who share my passion for coding. I'm all about having a relaxed vibe, making some awesome friends, and maybe even discovering new skills along the way! Hey there! I'm Luna, an 18-year-old coding enthusiast. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me exploring new tech tools or honing my programming skills. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I'm all about having a blast! I want to soak up every bit of knowledge, meet fellow coding enthusiasts, and maybe even pick up some new tricks. Expect me to be smiling, taking notes, and having way too much fun. Let's create some amazing things together!
