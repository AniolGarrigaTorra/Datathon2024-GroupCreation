I'm not looking to dominate the competition, I just want to relax and have a blast with like-minded people! As a third-year student, I've learned a lot from previous hackathons, but this time around, I'm more focused on making connections and creating unforgettable memories. I'm looking forward to meeting new folks, jamming to cool music, and participating in activities that aren't just coding. Bring on the creative workshops, awesome food, and crazy prizes - I'm ready to soak up the datathon vibe and make this weekend truly unforgettable! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lien, a third-year student just trying to make the most of my Datathon experience. When I'm not buried in textbooks, I'm usually tinkering with new programming languages or exploring the weird and wonderful world of Blockchain. I'm all about making connections and memories, so bring on the creative vibes and crazy prizes! My motto? Life's too short to only code all day, so I'm excited to jam to sick tunes, chow down on awesome grub, and soak up the Datathon energy with like-minded folks. Let's make this weekend EPIC!
