Hey, I'm Aurélien! My goal for this datathon is to improve my skills and knowledge in programming and data analysis. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I feel like I'm still learning and I want to take this opportunity to level up. I'd love to get my hands dirty with some new technologies, tackle some interesting projects, and learn from others in the community. I'm not really competitive, so I won't be gunning for the win, but I'd love to come out of this feeling more confident and inspired to take on more challenges. Hey there! I'm Aurélien, a second-year student with a passion for problem-solving and learning. I've dipped my toes into programming and data analysis, and I'm excited to dive deeper. I'm always on the lookout for ways to optimize and simplify processes, whether it's through coding or finding creative workarounds. When I'm not studying, you can find me jamming out to music or exploring new art styles. I'm eager to share my enthusiasm and enthusiasm with like-minded individuals and learn from them in return.
