I'm in this datathon to crush it and take home the gold! I'm competitive by nature, and I thrive under pressure. My goal is to be one of the top few solutions and bring home the prize. I'll be diving headfirst into every challenge, pushing my limits, and giving it my all. I'm not here to mess around or just have a good time - I'm here to win, and I'll stop at nothing to make it happen. Expect to see me fully focused and totally absorbed in solving each problem, no distractions allowed! Hey, I'm Sofía Elżbieta Vazquez, a 21-year-old programming enthusiast driven by a competitive spirit. I'm currently crushing it in my 4th year of studies and aiming to take my skills to the next level. I thrive under pressure and love diving headfirst into new challenges. Data analysis and machine learning are my jam, and I'm all about finding creative solutions. Outside of coding, you can catch me jamming to tunes or creating digital art. For this datathon, expect me to be fully focused and giving it my all to claim the top spot - bring it on!
