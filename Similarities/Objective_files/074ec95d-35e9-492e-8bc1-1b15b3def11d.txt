My goal for this datathon is to give it my all and come out on top. I've competed in six hackathons before and know what it takes to win. I'm ready to put in the long hours, collaborate with my teammates, and deliver a top-notch project. I'm competitive by nature and I want to prove to myself that I can conquer this challenge. Bring it on - I'm ready to crush this datathon and take home the win! Hey there! I'm Ana√Øs Delphine Rodriguez, a 22-year-old fourth-year student with a passion for coding. I've got a proven track record of hacking success, having participated in six hackathons before this one. When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me tweaking mobile apps or conjuring up lifehacks to simplify my day. I thrive in fast-paced environments and love pushing myself to reach new heights. With a keen eye for innovation and a willingness to learn, I'm excited to dive into the datathon and show what I'm made of!
