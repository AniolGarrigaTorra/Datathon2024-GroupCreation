My goal for this datathon is to take it as an opportunity to level up my programming skills. I've had some experience with coding, but I'm looking to dive deeper into certain areas and learn more about the latest technologies. I'm excited to be surrounded by other like-minded individuals and get hands-on experience working on real-world projects. I'm looking forward to learning from feedback, asking questions, and improving my problem-solving skills. Bring it on - I'm ready to challenge myself and take away valuable knowledge! Hi! I'm Eva, and I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon. As a fourth-year student, I'm always looking for ways to take my programming skills to the next level. I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact, whether it's through innovative mobile solutions or cutting-edge educational tools. I'm excited to dive in and learn from my fellow participants, and I'm not afraid to ask for help or feedback to improve my skills. Let's do this!
