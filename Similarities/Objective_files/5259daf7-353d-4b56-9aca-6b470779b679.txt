As a data enthusiast, my goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and knowledge in programming and data analysis. I'm looking to take on new challenges, learn from fellow participants, and absorb as much as I can from the expert mentors. I'm excited to dive into new projects, explore different tools and techniques, and hopefully come out with some tangible takeaways. My objective is to improve my coding chops, expand my understanding of data science, and walk away with a fresh perspective and new ideas to apply to my studies and future projects. Hey everyone! I'm Laia SÃ¡nchez, a 21-year-old student with a passion for innovation. When I'm not studying, you can find me indulging in my creative side through music and art. As an intermediate programmer, I'm constantly seeking new challenges and knowledge. I'm excited to level up my skills and broaden my understanding of data analysis during this datathon. With a keen interest in improving healthcare through technology, I'm looking forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and mentors to achieve my objectives. I'm a curious and adaptable learner, and I'm thrilled to dive into this experience!
