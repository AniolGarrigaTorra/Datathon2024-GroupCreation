My objective for this datathon is to level up my skills and knowledge in programming. I've had some experience, but I know I've still got a lot to learn. I'm looking to dive deep into new technologies and learn from the experts here. I want to take on new challenges and solve complex problems, even if it means going outside my comfort zone. My ultimate goal is to come away from this event with some concrete skills and a solid understanding of areas I previously knew little about. It's going to be a learning sprint, and I'm stoked! Hey there! I'm Ana Luisa, a third-year student with a passion for using tech to make a positive impact. I've got some experience under my belt, but I'm eager to take my skills to the next level. I'm all about tackling tough problems and learning from my mistakes. At the datathon, I'm looking to dive into new tech and challenge myself in ways that push me outside my comfort zone. I'm excited to collaborate with others who share my energy and enthusiasm, and I'm ready to learn as much as I can. Let's crush it!
