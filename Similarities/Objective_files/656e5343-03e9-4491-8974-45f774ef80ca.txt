My objective for this datathon is to dive headfirst into learning new technologies and improving my coding skills. As a junior in my degree, I'm keen to develop my abilities and build a strong foundation in data analysis. I'm excited to challenge myself and take on tasks that push me out of my comfort zone. I'm also hoping to network with experienced professionals and like-minded participants, so I can learn from their experiences and gain valuable insights into the industry. Hey! I'm SÃ­lvia, a third-year student with a passion for innovation and technology. As a coding enthusiast, I'm always looking to push my boundaries and learn new skills. I've dabbled in various areas, from game development to AI, and am excited to explore even more during this datathon. My goal is to develop my data analysis skills and get out of my comfort zone by tackling new challenges. I'm also looking forward to networking with like-minded individuals and learning from their experiences. I'm here to grow, learn, and make the most of this amazing opportunity!
