My objective is to crush it at this datathon and take home the top prize. I'm a competitive person by nature, and I love the rush of adrenaline I get from going head-to-head with other developers. I've participated in four hackathons before, and I've come close to winning a few times, but I'm determined to take home the trophy this time around. I'll be spending every waking moment during the datathon researching, coding, and testing to make sure my project is top-notch. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lie Rodriguez Simmons, a second-year student who's passionate about pushing the boundaries of innovation. I've had my fair share of hackathons under my belt, but this one's going to be different. I'm here to take it to the next level, to give it my all and walk away with the top prize. I thrive in fast-paced environments where creativity and problem-solving come into play. You can find me cozied up with my laptop, sipping on coffee, and surrounded by coding materials. Bring on the competition - let's crush it!
