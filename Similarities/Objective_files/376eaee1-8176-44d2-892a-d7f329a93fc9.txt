Hey, I'm Mariona! I'm all about makin' new friends, havin' a blast, and soaking up as much fun as I can at this datathon. Don't get me wrong, I'll still put in the effort and learn some new skills, but my top priority is chillin' with fellow data geeks, taking part in as many events as I can, and just generally having a wicked time. I'd love to connect with others who share my passion for data and make some unforgettable memories together! Hey there! I'm Mariona, a 21-year-old student on a mission to make the most of this datathon. When I'm not cramming for exams, you can find me browsing life hack videos or scouring online forums for tips on maximizing productivity. I'm super excited to dive into the world of data analysis and connect with like-minded enthusiasts. I'm all about vibes, so let's have a blast learning and growing together! Looking forward to making some unforgettable memories and soaking up as much fun as I can. See you around!
