Hi! I'm Aurèlia. I'm really excited to be participating in this datathon! My goal is to learn as much as I can and improve my skills. I want to stretch my programming abilities and explore new technologies and concepts. I'd love to dive deeper into machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization. Throughout this datathon, I aim to step out of my comfort zone and tackle challenges that push me to grow as a developer. I'm looking forward to the opportunities to learn from experienced professionals and connect with fellow participants! Hi! I'm Aurèlia, a 19-year-old second-year student who's all about embracing new challenges and having fun while learning. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, where I can hone my coding skills, explore new tech areas, and push myself to grow as a developer. In my free time, I love tinkerering with IoT devices, trying out new lifehacks, and getting creative with UI/UX design. Can't wait to connect with fellow participants, share ideas, and make some amazing memories!
