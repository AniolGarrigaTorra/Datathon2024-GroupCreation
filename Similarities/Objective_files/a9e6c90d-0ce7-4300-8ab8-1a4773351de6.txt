As a data enthusiast, I, Sofía Valencia, am excited to participate in this datathon with the objective of learning new things and improving my skills. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into different data manipulation and visualization tools, and exploring innovative ways to present complex data insights. My goal is to challenge myself by taking on new projects, seeking feedback from mentors, and sharing knowledge with fellow participants. I'm confident that this datathon will provide the perfect environment to grow as a data enthusiast and return home with valuable skills and experiences that will aid me in my future endeavors. Hey there! I'm Sofía, a 22-year-old student with a passion for learning and problem-solving. With a background in programming, I've had the opportunity to dabble in various areas, from artificial intelligence to Android development. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I can challenge myself and learn from others. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to music or experimenting with new artistic techniques. My goal is to push my limits and walk away with newfound skills and insights. I'm looking forward to this journey and the connections I'll make along the way!
