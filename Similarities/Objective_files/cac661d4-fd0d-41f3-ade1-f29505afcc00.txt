I'm all about winning this datathon! I've had a solid foundation in programming since starting my second year of university, and I'm eager to showcase my skills and take home the top prize. My goal is to stay focused, work hard, and crush each challenge that comes my way. I'm not interested in playing it safe or taking unnecessary risks - I'm in this to prove myself and come out on top. Bring on the puzzles, and I'll be ready to take 'em down! Hi! I'm Luc√≠a Rachel, a 20-year-old university student with a passion for solving real-world problems. As a programmer with a strong foundation in tech, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to prove my skills. My goal is to make a lasting impact, and I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to this datathon. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over the latest AI and Fintech innovations or practicing my designs in UI/UX. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but I'm ready to put my skills to the test and come out on top!
