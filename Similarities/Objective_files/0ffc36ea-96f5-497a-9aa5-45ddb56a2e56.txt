As a seasoned hackathon veteran, I'm all about competition! I've got 5 under my belt, and I'm coming into this datathon hungry for victory. My objective is clear: I want to give it my all and push myself to the limits to take home that top spot. I'm ready to pour over code, analyze data, and creatively problem-solve my way to the top. I'm not looking to make friends (although that's a bonus!), nor am I looking to learn new skills (although, who knows, that might happen too!). I'm in this to win it! Hi, I'm Alejandra! I'm a 21-year-old coding enthusiast and hackathon veteran. With three hackathons under my belt, I'm looking to take my skills to the next level and claim that top spot. I thrive under pressure, and my experience with iOS development and Agile methodology has taught me the importance of prioritizing and pushing boundaries. When I'm not coding, you can find me devouring tech trends and exploring new technologies. I'm here to crush it and make my mark - bring on the challenges!
