As Sofia Torrent, I'm excited to dive into this datathon! My objective is to focus on learning new things and improving my skills. I'm at a great point in my 3rd year of uni where I've gained some solid foundation in programming, but I know there's still so much more to discover.

Whether it's mastering new tools, techniques, or understanding specific domain knowledge, I'm ready to absorb and grow as a developer. Bring on the learning! Hey there!
