Hey! My objective for this datathon is all about growth and improvement. I'm a student and programmer looking to further develop my skills and knowledge in data analysis. I want to challenge myself by diving into new tools and technologies, and push my problem-solving abilities to the next level. I'm excited to collaborate with others, learn from their experiences, and create something tangible by the end of the datathon. Bring it on, and let's code our way to greatness! Hey everyone! I'm Sof√≠a Rae Johnson, a 21-year-old student and programmer. I'm super passionate about learning new skills and applying them to real-world problems.
