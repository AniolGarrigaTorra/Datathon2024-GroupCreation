Hey there! My objective for this datathon is to make some awesome connections and have a blast while doing it. I'm all about the experience and enjoying the journey, not just about winning. I'd love to take advantage of all the fun events, workshops, and activities, and get to know fellow datathon enthusiasts who share my enthusiasm for data and tech. I'm super excited to be here and see where it takes me! Hi everyone! I'm Ana, a 19-year-old student with a passion for the intersection of technology and human connection. I'm on a mission to experience the excitement of this datathon, learn from fellow participants, and soak up new ideas. When I'm not hitting the books, I love tinkering with new projects and exploring how AI can improve people's lives. I'm a curious and optimistic person, always up for a challenge. I'm stoked to be here and share my enthusiasm with like-minded individuals!
