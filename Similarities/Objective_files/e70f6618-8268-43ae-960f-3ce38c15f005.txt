Hi! As Ana Sofia Wagner, my goal for this datathon is to take it as an opportunity to level up my programming skills and learn new things. I'm looking forward to digging deep into the challenges and exercises, and seeing how I can apply what I've learned so far to tackle more complex problems. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone, experiment with new tools and languages, and come out of this event feeling confident and more proficient as a developer. Bring on the learning opportunities! Hey there! I'm Ana Sofia Wagner, a 22-year-old student with a passion for programming. I'm currently in my 4th year and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level. When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me exploring new tech tools and languages. I'm a total nerd at heart and I love how coding allows me to turn my ideas into reality. I'm looking forward to a weekend of challenge and discovery, and I hope to come out of this datathon feeling more confident and proficient as a developer.
