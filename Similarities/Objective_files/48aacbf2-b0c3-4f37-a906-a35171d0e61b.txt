Hey! I'm Sofía Elena Wallace. For this datathon, I'm all about having a blast, meeting new people, and diving into all the amazing events they're planning. I'm looking to make some awesome connections and lifelong friends. I'll be the one with the biggest smile, asking silly questions, and laughing with fellow participants. My goal is to have an incredible experience, learn something new along the way, and leave with a sense of fulfillment. I'm all about making the most of this opportunity and having an unforgettable time! Hey there! I'm Sofía Elena Wallace, a 20-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. I'm all about exploring the intersection of creativity and innovation, and I'm excited to dive into the datathon with an open mind and a willingness to learn. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me experimenting with music production or painting. I'm a hopeless optimist, always looking for ways to connect with like-minded folks and make new friends. See you around, and let's make this datathon one to remember!
