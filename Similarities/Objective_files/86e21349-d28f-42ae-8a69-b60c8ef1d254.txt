My goal for this datathon is to give it my all and come out on top. I've participated in three hackathons before, and I've got the competitive bug - I love the rush of adrenaline when I'm coding on a tight deadline, and I'm always trying to improve my skills. For me, winning is not just about the prizes or bragging rights (although those are nice too), it's about testing my abilities and pushing myself to be the best. I'm ready to put in the hard work and grind to take home that top spot! Hey there! I'm Sofia Garc√≠a Ventura, an 18-year-old student with a passion for taking on challenges and testing my limits. In my free time, I enjoy finding innovative ways to solve everyday problems and exploring the latest technologies. With my experience in programming and competing in hackathons, I'm always up for a thrilling coding competition. I'm fueled by a relentless drive to improve and an addiction to the rush of adrenaline that comes with coding on a tight deadline. I'm stoked to be here and give it my all to take home the top spot!
