Hey there! My name is Sofía, and I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon. My goal is to dive head-first into the world of data analysis and machine learning. I'm hoping to learn as much as I can from the other participants, mentors, and speakers. I want to improve my programming skills, specifically my Python skills, and explore new tools and technologies. Ultimately, I'm looking to challenge myself and come away from this event with a deeper understanding of data analysis and a few new tricks up my sleeve! Hey there! I'm Sofía, a first-year student with a passion for making a positive impact through data. I'm excited to be part of this datathon and learn from amazing individuals. I've had a basic foundation in programming, and I'm eager to dive deeper into data analysis and machine learning. I'm intrigued by how data can be used to improve lives, particularly in education and healthcare. My ultimate goal is to gain hands-on experience and walk away with new skills and perspectives. I'm looking forward to an incredible experience with all of you!
