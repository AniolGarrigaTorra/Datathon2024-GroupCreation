My main objective for this datathon is to step out of my comfort zone and learn as much as I can. I'm looking to improve my programming skills and expand my knowledge in data analysis. I'm excited to work with new technologies and approaches, and get hands-on experience with real-world data. My goal is to come out of this event with a newfound understanding of how to tackle complex data-driven problems and a network of peers who can help me grow as a programmer. Hey there! I'm Sofia Estrada, a first-year student trying to shake off the beginner's blues. I'm excited to be a part of this datathon, hoping to push myself beyond my comfort zone and dive head-first into the world of data analysis. With a background in programming and design, I'm looking to improve my skills and tap into the power of data-driven solutions. I'm a curious and creative problem-solver, and I'm thrilled to be surrounded by like-minded folks who share my passion for exploring the intersection of tech and innovation. Let's get this datathon started!
