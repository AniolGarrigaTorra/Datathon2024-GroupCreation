Hey there! My name is Àgata, and I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon. Honestly, I'm not trying to win or compete with anyone - I just want to have a blast! I'm all about making new friends, trying new things, and having a great time with fellow participants. For me, this datathon is about immersing myself in a fun environment, learning new skills, and discovering cool projects alongside amazing people. Can't wait to participate in all the events, enjoy the vibes, and make some incredible memories! Hey there! I'm Àgata, and I'm stoked to be here at the datathon! As a first-year student, I'm super curious and always up for a challenge. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and how they can make a difference in people's lives. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkerin' with AR/VR, diving into databases, or figuring out ways to make my daily life more productive. For me, this datathon is all about meeting like-minded folks, trying new things, and having an epic time - let's make some awesome memories together!
