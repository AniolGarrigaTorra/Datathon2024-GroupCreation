For me, datathons are all about competition. I'm all in to try and take home that top prize! I've been programming for a few years now and I think I have a good grasp on some essential skills, but I'm ready to put my skills to the test and show off what I can really do. I'm focused on pushing myself to innovate, be creative, and deliver high-quality projects. My objective is to win, plain and simple. Bring it on, datathon challenges! Hey there! I'm Alessia Fiori, a third-year student with a passion for programming. I've been coding for a while now, and I'm always up for a challenge. In my free time, I love tinkering with tech-related projects and finding new ways to simplify tasks. My favorite thing about datathons is the thrill of competing against other skilled programmers and pushing myself to be better. My goal is to win, and I'm confident that my strong work ethic and problem-solving skills will help me achieve it. I'm excited to join this datathon and see what it has in store for me!
