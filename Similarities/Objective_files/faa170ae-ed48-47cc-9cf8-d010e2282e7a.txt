My goal for this datathon is to soak up the excitement and meet some awesome people! As a newbie in the data world, I'm looking forward to learning from others and growing as a developer. At the same time, I want to make the most of my first datathon experience and have a blast doing it! I'm excited to participate in events, attend workshops, and join discussions - anything that'll help me connect with fellow participants and take away some unforgettable memories. Hey! I'm Ana√Øs, a curious and driven 17-year-old who's all about exploring the cutting-edge of tech. With a passion for making a positive impact, I'm excited to dive into the world of data analysis. As a newbie, I'm eager to soak up knowledge and make connections with fellow enthusiasts. When I'm not coding, you can find me daydreaming about futuristic robots or geeking out over quantum physics. For now, I'm stoked to be here, learning, and having a blast with fellow participants. Let's make this datathon one to remember!
