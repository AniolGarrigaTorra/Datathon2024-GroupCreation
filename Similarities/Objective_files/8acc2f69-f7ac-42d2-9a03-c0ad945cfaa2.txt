My goal for this datathon is clear-cut: I'm in it to win it. I've participated in six hackathons so far and I'm ready to take it to the next level. I've honed my programming skills to an advanced level and I'm confident in my ability to deliver a killer project. I'm not just here for the fun and social aspect (although I do love meeting new people), I'm here to take on the challenge and come out on top. Expect to see me buried deep in code, burning the midnight oil to get that perfect solution. Hey, I'm Ava! I'm a 22-year-old computer science student with a passion for using technology to make a real impact. I've been programming for years and have a knack for whipping up innovative solutions. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me brainstorming ideas or building side projects. I'm a natural problem-solver and love the thrill of a challenge. I'm all about pushing boundaries and exceeding expectations, which is why I'm here for this datathon - to show what I'm capable of and take home that top prize!
