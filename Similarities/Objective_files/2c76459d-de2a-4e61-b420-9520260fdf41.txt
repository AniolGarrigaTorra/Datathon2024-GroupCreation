I'm all about crushing it this datathon! My objective is to put in the most effort possible and outshine the rest. I want to push my skills to the limit, work with a killer team, and come out on top with the best project. I've had a taste of hackathons before and I know how to stay focused and motivated. I'm determined to learn from other participants, leverage the resources provided, and create something that wows the judges. I'm ready to put in the sweat and tears necessary to take home that top prize! Hi! I'm Aurora Camila Fonseca, a 20-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I've got some experience under my belt when it comes to programming, and I'm always looking to level up. This datathon is my chance to do just that. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments, and I'm all about staying focused and motivated. I'm here to push my skills to the limit, make new connections, and learn from the best. Bring on the challenge - I'm ready to put in the work and have a blast doing it!
