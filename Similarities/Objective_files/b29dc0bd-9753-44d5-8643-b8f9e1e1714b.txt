Hey! My objective for this datathon is to soak up as much knowledge as I can and level up my programming skills. I'm an 18-year-old student, and while I've participated in a few hackathons before, I feel like I still have a lot to learn. I'm excited to dive into new technologies and work on projects that challenge me. I'm not really competing to win, but rather to improve my coding skills and confidence. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow data enthusiasts, asking questions, and gaining valuable experience in the process! Hey there!
