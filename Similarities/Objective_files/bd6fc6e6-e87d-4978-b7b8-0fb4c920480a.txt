My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this experience! I want to meet new people, learn from them, and share my own skills too. I'm not super competitive, so I'm not here to win or stress too much about that. Instead, I want to attend as many workshops and talks as possible, participate in challenges when I can, and soak up all the knowledge and fun the datathon has to offer. My main goal is to make friends, have a blast, and come out feeling like I've grown both personally and professionally. Hey everyone! I'm Ava, a 21-year-old university student diving into the world of data for the first time. I'm excited to challenge myself and learn from some amazing people. When I'm not studying, I love tinkering with programming and exploring innovative technologies like blockchain. My goal for this datathon is to soak up new knowledge, make friends, and grow as a person and a professional. I'm looking forward to the fun and laid-back vibe of the event, and I'm eager to share my own skills and learn from others in a super supportive environment!
