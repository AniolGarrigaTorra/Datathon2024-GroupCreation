As a datathon enthusiast, my main goal is to learn new things and improve my skills! With a solid foundation in programming, I'm excited to dive deeper into data science and explore different tools and techniques. I'm looking forward to working with diverse teams, picking the brains of experts, and tackling real-world problems to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I want to emerge from this datathon with fresh insights, expanded skillset, and the confidence to take on more ambitious projects. By doing so, I'm sure I'll have a ton of fun along the way! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a third-year student with a passion for data and technology. With a solid foundation in programming, I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. I'm fascinated by the intersection of product development and data analysis, and I'm looking forward to working on real-world projects that challenge me. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new e-commerce startups or geeking out over quantum physics. Let's get competitive and have some fun!
