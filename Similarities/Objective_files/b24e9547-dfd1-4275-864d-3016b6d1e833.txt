I'm all about having a blast and making meaningful connections with fellow participants! As a 2nd-year student, I've already had some experience with hackathons, but my focus is on enjoying the ride, meeting new people, and soaking up as much fun as possible. I'll be attending as many workshops and events as I can, and I'm stoked to learn new skills and take on new challenges along the way. Bring on the team-building activities and social mixers - let's make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Mara Esteve, an 18-year-old student living for data thrills! I'm about to embark on my second year in university, and I'm stoked to be joining this datathon. I've had a taste of hackathon life before, and I'm looking forward to a fun-filled weekend with like-minded folks. I'm all about taking the road less traveled, whether it's dabbling in Fintech or diving into Blockchain innovations. In the world of code, I've got a thing or two about crafting meaningful connections with React and Python. Let's create something crazy together!
