My objective for this datathon is to win, plain and simple. I've participated in seven hackathons so far and I've learned a thing or two about the field, but I'm still hungry for that top prize. I'm ready to dive headfirst into the competition, leveraging my advanced programming skills and doctoral-level knowledge to bring home the win. I'm not here to make friends (although, who knows, maybe I'll make some along the way!) or learn new things (although, let's be real, I'll definitely pick up some new skills). I'm here to compete and emerge victorious. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Luna Bianchi, a 27-year-old PhD student with a passion for coding. When I'm not pouring over code, you can find me geeking out over the latest fintech trends or jamming out to electronic music. With seven hackathons under my belt, I'm on a mission to win the top prize. I'm not here to make friends, but to unleash my coding skills and show what I'm capable of. Expect fiery intensity and an unwavering commitment to my objective. Bring on the challenge!
