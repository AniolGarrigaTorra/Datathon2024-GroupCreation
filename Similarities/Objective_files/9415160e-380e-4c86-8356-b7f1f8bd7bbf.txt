My main goal for this datathon is to come out on top! I'm all about competition and I'm pumped to put my skills to the test against other participants. I'm confident that my Beginner-level programming skills have improved significantly since my last hackathon experience, and I'm ready to take on the challenges that this datathon has to offer. I'll be focusing on designing and building the most innovative project possible, and I'm not going to stop until I've got the highest quality outcome. Wish me luck - I'm going to crush this datathon! Hey there! I'm Luna Faye, a 19-year-old tech-enthusiast with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I'm a junior student, and my programming journey started relatively recently, but I've already caught the bug. I'm all about competition and thrive under pressure, which is why I'm super pumped to be here at the datathon. With a focus on design and development, I aim to bring my A-game and produce something truly remarkable. My experience with iOS development has given me a keen eye for UI/UX, and I'm looking forward to combining my creativity with tech savvy to crush this datathon!
