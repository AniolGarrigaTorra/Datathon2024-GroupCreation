My main objective for this datathon is to take my skills to the next level. I'm in my third year of uni, and I want to get hands-on experience with real-world projects. I'm hoping to learn some new tricks and gain more confidence in my coding abilities. I'm also looking forward to learning from others and getting feedback on my projects. If I can walk away from this event with some solid skills and new perspectives, I'll be stoked! Hi! I'm Aur√©lia, a 21-year-old university student excited to be part of this datathon.
