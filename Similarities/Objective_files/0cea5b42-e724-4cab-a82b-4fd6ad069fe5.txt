I'm in this datathon to come out on top! I've been competing in hackathons for a while now, and I'm confident in my abilities. I've got my sights set on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the hard work to get it. I'll be diving headfirst into the problems, pouring over data and writing code till the wee hours. My goal is to be crowned the winner, and I won't settle for anything less. Wish me luck! Hey there! I'm Alessandra Bassa, a third-year student with a passion for problem-solving and code-crushing. I've been around the block a few times, competing in hackathons and building projects that blend technology with innovation. I'm all about making a dent in the universe, one line of code at a time. You can count on me to bring my A-game, with a competitive spirit that drives me to deliver high-quality solutions on the fly. I'm ready to dive headfirst into this datathon, and I won't stop till I've conquered the problem set. Wish me luck!
