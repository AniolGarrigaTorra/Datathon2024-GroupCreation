My objective for this datathon is to win. I've competed in six hackathons before, and I've gotten to the finals twice, so I know what it takes to take home the gold. This time, I'm determined to make it happen. I'll be pouring all my energy into solving the challenges quickly and efficiently, and I won't be satisfied with anything less than first place. I've studied my favorite libraries and tools, and I've crafted a solid plan to tackle the datathon challenges. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Sof√≠a! I'm a third-year student with a passion for programming and innovation. I've had my share of hackathon wins and I'm determined to take home the gold this time around. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to some sick beats or vibing with the art world. My ultimate goal is to win, but I'm also looking forward to learning from fellow datathonners and having an awesome time. Bring on the challenges - I'm ready to pour my heart and soul into this and make it happen!
