Hey! As a beginner coder, I'm super excited to participate in this datathon! My objective is to learn as much as I can and improve my programming skills. I've had some basic coding classes in school, but I'm looking to dive deeper and gain more hands-on experience with real-world projects. I'd love to explore new technologies, frameworks, and tools and learn from more experienced participants and mentors. Ultimately, I want to leave this datathon with a new set of skills and a confidence boost that'll help me tackle more complex projects in my future studies. Hey! I'm Lilya, a 17-year-old student just starting my first year of programming. I'm super excited to be a part of this datathon and dive deeper into the world of coding. I've had some basic classes, but I'm ready to learn and improve my skills. I'm interested in finding ways to apply programming to make a real-world impact. I'm also looking to meet new people and learn from their experiences. I'm confident that this datathon will give me the hands-on practice and exposure I need to become a more confident and skilled programmer.
