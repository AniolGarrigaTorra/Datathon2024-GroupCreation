Hey! I'm Ana Sofia, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! Honestly, I'm here to make the most of this experience and have a blast doing it. My objective is to connect with like-minded people, make new friends, and participate in as many fun events as possible. I want to learn and improve my skills, but let's be real, I'm also super excited to enjoy the atmosphere, try new food, and just soak up the datathon vibe. I'm all about creating unforgettable memories and walking away from this with a full heart and a big smile Hey! I'm Ana Sofia, and I'm thrilled to be here! I'm a 19-year-old student just diving into the world of programming. I'm super curious and eager to learn, with a passion for making things that can touch people's lives. I've dabbled in AR/VR, and love the idea of creating immersive experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying out new recipes in the kitchen or jamming out to indie tunes. I'm here to make new friends, have fun, and soak up the datathon energy!
