For me, this datathon is an amazing opportunity to level up my skills and learn from the best. I'm looking forward to diving into new technologies and methods to improve my programming skills. I'd love to take away insights on how to approach complex data-related problems, as well as strategies for efficiently working with data visualizations. My goal is to learn as much as possible, collaborate with others, and take home new ideas and techniques to apply to my studies and future projects. Hi everyone! I'm Sof√≠a, a third-year student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. I've been dabbling in programming for a few years now, and I'm excited to level up my skills at this datathon. I'm particularly drawn to projects that combine tech with creativity, like data visualization and design. Outside of coding, I'm also a bit of an artist and music lover. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts and taking away valuable insights to inform my studies and future projects.
