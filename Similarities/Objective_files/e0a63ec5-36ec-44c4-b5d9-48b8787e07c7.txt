My main objective for this datathon is to go all out and give it my all to win. I've participated in four hackathons before and I know what it takes to take the top spot. I'm ready to dive headfirst into the challenge, pour all my energy into solving the problem, and outsmart the competition. My goal is to outdo myself and come out on top. I'm confident that my programming skills and experience will pay off, and I'm excited to put them to the test. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Ana Sofía Rodríguez, a 21-year-old student with a passion for taking on tough challenges. I've already won three hackathons under my belt and I'm determined to add to my collection. When I'm not coding, I'm usually designing new UIs or digging deep into data analysis. Health and cybersecurity are areas that really fascinate me, and I believe that with the right tech, we can change the game. I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon and I'm ready to give it my all to take the top spot!
