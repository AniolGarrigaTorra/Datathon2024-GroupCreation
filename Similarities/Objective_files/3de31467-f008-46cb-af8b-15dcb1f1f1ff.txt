My objective for this datathon is to come out on top! I've participated in one hackathon before and got a taste of the competitive spirit. This time, I'm determined to push myself to the limit and give it my all. I'm ready to immerse myself in the data, stay up late coding, and outsmart the competition. My goal is to take home the prize and be recognized for my skills. Bring it on! Hi, I'm Katarina Sofia Reinhard! I'm a 21-year-old student who's always been driven by a desire to solve problems and make a difference. I have a passion for tech, and I've been coding for a while now. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me indulging in my love for gaming, music, and art. I'm excited to join this datathon, where I can put my skills to the test and push myself to new heights. I'm all about the thrill of competition, and I'm ready to take on this challenge and see where it takes me!
