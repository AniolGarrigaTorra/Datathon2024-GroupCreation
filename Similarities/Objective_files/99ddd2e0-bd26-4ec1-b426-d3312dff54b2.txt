Honestly, my top priority is to bring home the win! I've got my competitive hat on and I'm determined to push myself to the limit to achieve top spot. I've learned a ton from my previous hackathon experiences, and I'm ready to take it to the next level. I'm looking forward to the adrenaline rush of staying up all night to work on my project, and the thrill of presenting my idea to the judges. My goal is simple: to take home the title and claim bragging rights among my peers! Hey there, I'm Emily Rachel Flynn! I'm a 2nd-year student looking to make a splash at this datathon. I'm all about staying ahead of the curve and I'm always up for a challenge. I've had a taste of competition in hackathons before and I'm hooked! I thrive under pressure and love the rush of adrenaline that comes with trying to push my project to the top. My motto? Bring it on! I'm stoked to be here and I'm looking forward to seeing what this weekend brings. See you on the competition floor!
