Hey! So, I'm excited to participate in this datathon and approach it with a super relaxed vibe. My objective is to make some awesome new friends, have a blast, and take part in as many events as possible. I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere, learning a bit, and having some unforgettable moments with like-minded folks. I'm not too worried about winning; I just want to enjoy the experience, network with others, and maybe discover some new skills along the way. Let's have a rad time, datathon fam! Hey y'all! I'm Sophie, a 21-year-old student livin' life one datathon at a time! I'm in my fourth year, and I'm all about programming. I've got a super curious mind and love experimenting with new tech. You can find me chillin' with my pals, playing some games or designing some sweet UI. I'm super excited to be here and can't wait to learn, grow, and make some awesome new friends. When I'm not coding, you can catch me jamming to some tunes or plotting out my next big adventure. Bring on the datathon vibes, fam!
