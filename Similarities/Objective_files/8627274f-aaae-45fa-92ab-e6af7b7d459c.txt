As Camila Isabelle LaFleur, my objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and improve my programming skills. I'm not as experienced as some of the other participants, so I'm really excited to dive into the challenges and learn from others. I'd love to pick up some new languages, get exposure to different technologies, and become more comfortable with data analysis and visualization. I know it's a competitive event, but I'm not necessarily looking to win - my goal is to leave here feeling more confident and prepared for my next project. Hey! I'm Camila LaFleur, an 18-year-old undergraduate with a passion for learning and a curiosity to improve the world around me. I've dabbled in programming, and now I'm excited to dive deeper and explore new technologies. I'm drawn to e-commerce and voice skills, as I believe they have the potential to make a significant impact on our daily lives. Throughout this datathon, I aim to grow not only as a programmer but also as a individual, and I'm looking forward to meeting fellow participants who share similar enthusiasm.
