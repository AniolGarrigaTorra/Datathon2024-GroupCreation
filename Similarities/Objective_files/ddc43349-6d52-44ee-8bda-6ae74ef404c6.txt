My objective for this datathon is clear-cut: I'm here to win. As a competitive person, I thrive under pressure and love the rush of adrenaline that comes with racing against the clock. I've participated in one hackathon before and took home a medal, so I know what it takes to perform under fire. My goal is to use my programming skills to their fullest potential, stay one step ahead of the competition, and bring home the top prize. It's time to test my mettle and show everyone what I'm capable of! Hey, I'm Evelyn Sawyer, a 21-year-old student looking to crush it at this datathon. With one hackathon under my belt and a hunger for competition, I'm feeling fired up to take on the challenge. I've got a passion for merging tech with creativity, whether it's through AR/VR or visual art. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to indie tunes or exploring new virtual worlds. My ultimate goal is to channel my energy into a winning solution that showcases my programming chops. Let the games begin!
