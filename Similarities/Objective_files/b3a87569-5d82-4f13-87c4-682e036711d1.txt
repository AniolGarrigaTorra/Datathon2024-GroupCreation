For this datathon, I'm all about having an awesome time and making some new buddies! I don't mind if my project idea isn't super original or if I don't win, as long as I get to hang out with other passionate people and learn something new along the way. I'm looking forward to attending workshops, meetups, and social events, and just soaking up all the energy and excitement of the datathon. My objective is to come out with some fantastic memories, and a bunch of new friends who share my enthusiasm for data and technology! Hey! I'm Luna, a 19-year-old student on a mission to make some unforgettable memories and friendships at this datathon. I'm all about being part of a vibrant community that shares my passion for data and tech. I'm excited to dive into workshops, mingle with like-minded individuals, and soak up new skills. If I'm being honest, I'm not super picky about the project - as long as it's fun and interactive, I'm game! Looking forward to meeting new people, sharing laughs, and maybe even finding a new partner-in-crime for future projects. See you around!
