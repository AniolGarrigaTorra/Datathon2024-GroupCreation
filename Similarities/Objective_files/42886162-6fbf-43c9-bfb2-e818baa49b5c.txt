My objective for this datathon is to have a blast with new people! I'm really looking forward to meeting fellow data enthusiasts and learning about their projects and passions. I don't have any prior experience in hackathons, so I'm all about soaking up the vibes, trying new things, and making some unforgettable memories. I'd love to attend as many workshops, panels, and social events as possible, and come away from this experience with a smile on my face and a list of new contacts to follow up with. Bring on the fun! Hey, I'm Maria Soler! I'm a 19-year-old student who's passionate about using technology to make a positive impact. I'm all about trying new things and exploring the latest innovations. For the datathon, I'm mostly looking to meet new people and learn about their projects and passions. I've had a little experience with programming, and I'm excited to see what others have been working on. Outside of programming, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest tech trends and discovering new ways that tech can be used to make the world a better place. Let's get started and have some fun!
