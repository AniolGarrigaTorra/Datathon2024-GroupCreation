My objective for this datathon is to win, plain and simple. I've been participating in hackathons for a few years now, and I've come close a few times, but I'm tired of just being in the top three. I want to take home that top prize and prove to myself that I have what it takes to be the best. I'm ready to put in the long hours, stay focused, and collaborate with the right team to bring home that win. My goal is clear: I'm not here to make friends or learn new skills, I'm here to win. Hey, I'm Sophia Estrada, an 18-year-old student with a hunger for coding competitions. I've been participating in hackathons for a few years now, and I'm determined to win this one. I've developed a passion for the tech industry, particularly IoT and blockchain. My goal is to push my skills to the limit and collaborate with a great team to take home the top prize. I'm confident in my abilities, and I'm ready to put in the hard work required to succeed. Bring it on, I'm ready to rock this datathon!
