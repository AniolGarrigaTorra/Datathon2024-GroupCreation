My objective for this datathon is to bring home that winning title! I've competed in three hackathons before, and I've learned so much from each experience. This time, I'm setting my sights on the top prize and I'm willing to put in the hard work to get it. I'll be digging deep to understand the problem statement, stay ahead of the curve on the latest technologies, and perfect my collaboration and communication skills. I want to be the one that judges are talking about when the results are announced. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 19-year-old data enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving and learning. I've had my share of hackathons, and I'm hooked on the rush of adrenaline that comes with pushing the boundaries of innovation. With a thirst for knowledge in quantum computing and education, I'm always on the lookout for challenges that will help me grow. I'm a people person, too - I thrive in collaborative environments and believe that communication is the key to success. For this datathon, I'm setting my sights high and ready to take on whatever comes my way!
