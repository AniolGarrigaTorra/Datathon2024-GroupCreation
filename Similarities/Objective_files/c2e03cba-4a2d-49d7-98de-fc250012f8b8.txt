Hey there! I'm Luna, and I'm super pumped to be part of this datathon! My goal is to bring home the gold (or at least, get really close!). I've been programming for a bit and have some experience under my belt, but I know this competition is going to be tough. I'm ready to put in the long hours, focus on writing top-notch code, and collaborate with my teammates to create something truly awesome. I want to walk away from this event feeling proud of what we've accomplished and knowing we gave it our all. Let's crush this! Hey, I'm Luna! A 19-year-old student with a burning passion for technology and problem-solving. I've dabbled in programming for a while now and I'm excited to put my skills to the test in this datathon. I'm a creative at heart, with a love for music, art, and education. In the data science world, I'm most drawn to cybersecurity and robotics - anything that combines logic with creativity sparks my interest! I'm all about learning, growth, and team collaboration, so let's make this datathon a thrilling ride!
