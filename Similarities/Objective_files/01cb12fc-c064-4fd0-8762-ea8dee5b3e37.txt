My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this experience and have an absolute blast! I'm all about meeting new people and forming connections, and what better way to do that than amidst a bunch of like-minded folks united by a shared passion for data? I'm stoked to participate in as many events as I can, learn something new each day, and, most importantly, build friendships that'll last beyond the datathon weekend. Let's have fun, share laughs, and create unforgettable memories! Hey everyone! I'm Lena, a 19-year-old student looking to make the most out of this datathon.
