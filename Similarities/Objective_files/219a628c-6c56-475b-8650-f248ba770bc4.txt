Hella! I'm so stoked to be here for this datathon! My goal is to dive headfirst into this amazing community and have an absolute blast. I'm all about meeting new people, learning new skills, and getting involved in as many cool projects as I can. I'm not as worried about winning first place (although, let's be real, it's always a nice bonus!). For me, it's all about the people, the connections, and the memories we'll make over the next 24 hours. Can't wait to hack, party, and maybe even discover my new fave cocktail Hey, I'm Sofia! I'm a third-year student living for innovation and excitement. When I'm not hitting the books, I love diving into new tech trends and exploring what's next in the world of Quantum and Gaming. I'm stoked to be here for the datathon and can't wait to join forces with fellow enthusiasts. My goal is to learn, create, and make unforgettable memories with this awesome community. I'm all about spreading positivity and making meaningful connections. Let's do this!
