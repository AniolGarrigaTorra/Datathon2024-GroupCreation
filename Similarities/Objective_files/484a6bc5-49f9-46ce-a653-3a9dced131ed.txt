My goal for this datathon is to come out on top - I'm a competitive person at heart, and I'm driven to win. I've always been impressed by the impressive projects that I've seen being presented at hackathons, and I'm eager to contribute to the world of data analysis. My plan is to dig deep, learn as much as I can about the topic, and push myself to come up with a unique and innovative solution. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Maya Rose Windsor, and I'm thrilled to be participating in this datathon. As a 17-year-old student, I'm eager to unleash my inner competitive streak and showcase my skills. With a passion for mobile and IoT technologies, I'm always looking for innovative ways to blend art and science. I'm driven, determined, and ready to dig in and learn as much as I can. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow datathon-ers and see where the weekend takes us! Let's make some magic happen!
