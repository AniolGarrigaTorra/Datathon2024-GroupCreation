My objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and level up my skills! As a student, I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and get hands-on experience with real-world problems. I'm especially interested in diving deeper into machine learning and data visualization. I want to leave this event with new tools in my toolbox, fresh insights to apply to my studies, and a sense of accomplishment from pushing my boundaries. Bring on the challenges and let me get to learning! Hey, I'm Laia Elena Summers, a 21-year-old student with a passion for using technology to make a positive impact.
