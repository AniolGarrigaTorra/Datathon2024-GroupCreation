Hey there! I'm Ruby, and my objective for this datathon is all about having a blast! I'm looking forward to making some awesome new friends and connections in the datathon community. I want to participate in as many events and activities as possible, whether it's a workshop, a meetup, or even just grabbing food with fellow participants. I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere and having a fun, stress-free experience. If I learn some new skills or make meaningful connections along the way, that's just the icing on the cake! Hey there! I'm Ruby Wynter, a 22-year-old student looking to kick back and have a blast at this datathon! I'm all about connecting with like-minded folks and taking in the vibe of this awesome community. As an intermediate programmer, I've dabbled in mobile dev and AI, and I'm excited to see what I can learn and discover with y'all. I'm a laid-back type who thrives in environments that are full of creativity and enthusiasm. Let's grab coffee, attend some workshops, and make some unforgettable memories together!
