My objective for this datathon is to have the most epic time ever! I'm all about making new friends, having a blast, and soaking up as many cool experiences as I can. I'm not super competitive, so I won't be stressing out about winning or losing. Instead, I'll be all about being present, learning as I go, and participating in as many events as I can. Whether it's a hackathon session, a team-building activity, or just a casual hangout, I'm here to make the most of this experience and leave with some awesome memories and friends! Hey there! I'm Aur√®lia Sofia Elliot, a 17-year-old student and total newb to the world of datathon-ing! I'm super stoked to be here and dive into the excitement. I'm always up for learning and trying new things, and datathons seem like the perfect blend of tech, fun, and community. When I'm not hitting the books or programming, I love exploring the intersections of tech and education - it's crazy how much innovation is happening out there! I'm here to soak up the vibes, meet awesome people, and make some unforgettable memories.
