Hey! My objective for this datathon is pretty simple: I want to have a blast, make new friends, and cram in as many fun events as possible! As a 2nd-year student, I'm still getting the hang of programming, and I think participating in this datathon is a great way to break out of my comfort zone and meet like-minded people. I'm all about creating unforgettable memories and taking on new challenges. If I happen to learn something new along the way, that's just icing on the cake! Hey there! I'm Ruby Paige Thompson, a 19-year-old student who's passionate about breaking the mold. I'm all about exploring new horizons and taking on exciting challenges. When I'm not in the classroom, you can find me jamming to music, dabbling in art, or getting lost in a good novel. I'm a bit of a tech geek at heart, and I'm stoked to be joining this datathon to push my boundaries and meet like-minded individuals. I'm all about creating unforgettable memories and learning something new along the way - the more unexpected, the better!
