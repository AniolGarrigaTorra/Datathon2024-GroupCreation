My main goal for this datathon is to level up my skills and learn as much as I can. I'm still a beginner in programming, so I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis and machine learning. I'm looking forward to challenging myself with new technologies and approaches, and I'm hoping to come away from this event with a stronger foundation in my studies. I'm not too worried about winning or losing - it's all about personal growth and becoming a better developer for me! Hey everyone! I'm Ana Sophia Rodriguez, a 19-year-old student looking to upgrade my coding game. As a beginner in programming, I'm all about learning new things and growing as a developer. I'm especially excited to dive into data analysis and machine learning - I think they have so much potential to make a positive impact on the world. My friends would describe me as creative, passionate, and always up for a challenge. Can't wait to meet my fellow data enthusiasts and see what the datathon brings!
