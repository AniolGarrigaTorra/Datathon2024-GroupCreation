Hey, my goal for this datathon is straightforward - I'm here to compete and win! As a third-year computer science student, I've honed my programming skills and I'm eager to put them to the test. I want to tackle the challenges head-on, learn from the judges' feedback, and outdo my fellow participants to claim the top spot. I'm all about strategy, efficiency, and pushing myself to the limit. If I can take home the prize, it'll be the icing on the cake. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a third-year computer science student looking to put my skills to the test in this datathon.
