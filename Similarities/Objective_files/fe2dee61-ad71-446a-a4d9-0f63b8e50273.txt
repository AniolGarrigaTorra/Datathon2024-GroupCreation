Hey there! So, for this datathon, my goal is to make new friends and have an amazing time. I'm not looking to stress myself out by trying to win or stressing over a specific project. Instead, I want to soak up as much knowledge as I can from the events, workshops, and fellow participants. I'm all about networking and meeting new people who share similar interests. I'd love to participate in as many hackathons, coding challenges, and other fun activities as I can, and just enjoy the overall atmosphere. Let's have a blast and learn together! Hey everyone! I'm Aida Santiago, a 20-year-old student looking forward to meeting all of you at the datathon. I'm all about innovation and staying curious. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me jamming to some tunes, sketching out design ideas, or trying out the latest app. I'm excited to immerse myself in a world of tech and connect with like-minded individuals who share my passions. Let's network, learn, and have a blast together! I'm looking forward to hearing about your projects and hobbies, and I'm always up for some friendly tech chatter.
