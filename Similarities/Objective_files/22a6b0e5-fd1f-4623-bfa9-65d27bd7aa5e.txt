I'm all about learning and improvement! For this datathon, my main objective is to enhance my programming skills, particularly in data analysis and visualization. I'm excited to dive deeper into various tools and techniques, and I'm hoping to challenge myself with new projects and scenarios. I'm not as concerned with winning as I am with walking away with a deeper understanding of data-intensive topics and a sense of accomplishment. By the end of this datathon, I aim to have picked up new tricks, refined my coding skills, and gained confidence in my ability to tackle complex data-related problems! Hi everyone! I'm LÃ©onie, a 21-year-old student with a passion for combining tech and creativity. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to improve processes and make an impact. With a background in design and programming, I'm excited to dive into data-intensive challenges and enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization. My goal is to learn and grow, not just win, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to collaborate and share my enthusiasm with like-minded individuals. Let's tackle those complex data problems and have some fun along the way!
