Hey! So, I'm Audrey, and my goal for this datathon is to soak up the vibe and enjoy the experience! I'm not really looking to compete with the best or win big prizes, I just want to have fun, meet new people, and learn a thing or two. I'd love to attend every event, participate in brainstorming sessions, and get involved in some awesome projects. By the end of it, I'd hope to have made some new friends, gathered a bunch of cool ideas, and had an absolute blast! Let's do this! Hi there!
