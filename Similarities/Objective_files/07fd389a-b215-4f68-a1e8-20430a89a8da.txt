I'm Alexandra, and my goal for this datathon is to come out on top. I've participated in three hackathons before, but this time I'm all about bringing home the prize. I'm confident in my skills, and I'm ready to push myself to the limit to create a revolutionary project. I'll be laser-focused on winning, studying other participants' work, and learning from their techniques to stay ahead of the competition. My motto is 'win at all costs', so watch out, datathon - Alexandra is in town to win! Hi there! I'm Alexandra, a determined and ambitious 20-year-old student with a passion for using technology to drive positive change. With three hackathons under my belt, I've developed a knack for working under pressure and an eagle eye for spotting innovative opportunities. I'm fueled by a relentless drive to win and a desire to create a lasting impact. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out over the latest AR/VR trends or tinkering with IoT gadgets. I'm stoked to be here and ready to bring my A-game to the datathon!
