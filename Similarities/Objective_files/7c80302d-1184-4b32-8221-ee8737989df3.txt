For me, this datathon is all about growth. As a programming newbie, I'm eager to learn and take my skills to the next level. I'd love to dive deep into data and explore how I can apply it to real-world problems. I'm excited to work with talented folks, pick their brains, and learn from their experiences. My objective is to not just survive the datathon, but to make meaningful connections, stay ahead of the curve, and come out with new insights and techniques to add to my toolkit. Bring on the data!
