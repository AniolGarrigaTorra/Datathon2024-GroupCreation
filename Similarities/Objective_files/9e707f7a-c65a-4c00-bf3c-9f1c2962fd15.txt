Honestly, I'm in it to win it! As a 20-year-old third-year student, I've got a taste for competition and I'm ready to put my coding skills to the test. I've participated in 4 hackathons already, and while I've had a blast, I'm now focused on taking my skills to the next level and claiming that top spot. My goal is to work tirelessly to come up with innovative solutions, collaborate with a team, and ultimately take home the prize. No distractions, no distractions, it's game on! Hey! I'm Sophia, a third-year student with a passion for solving real-world problems through coding. I've had a blast participating in hackathons, but I'm now gunning for that top spot! I'm a team player, always looking for ways to collaborate and learn from others. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, attending ed-tech conferences, or reading up on the latest advancements in Quantum Computing. I'm super enthusiastic, a bit competitive, and always up for a challenge. Looking forward to meeting and teaming up with you guys!
