I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! For me, it's all about leveling up my skills and knowledge. I've been programming since my teenage years, but I know there's always more to learn. I'm looking to dive deep into a topic that's been itching me to explore, whether it's machine learning or data visualization. I want to challenge myself, take calculated risks, and learn from the other brilliant minds here. Let's crush some problems together and come out even more awesome at the end of it all! Hey there! I'm Aur√©lia, a fourth-year student with a passion for all things tech. I've been coding since I was a teen and love exploring new areas. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to level up my skills and learn from others. I'm excited to dive into some challenges and take my problem-solving to the next level. Outside of academics, I enjoy designing for usability and love the intersection of tech and social good. I'm always up for a new adventure and can't wait to collaborate and learn with everyone at the datathon!
