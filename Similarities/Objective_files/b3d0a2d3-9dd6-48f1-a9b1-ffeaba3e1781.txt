Hey, I'm Sofía! My goal for this datathon is to have an amazing time with fellow participants, learn new tricks, and make new friends! I'm all about spreading the tech love and enthusiasm. I want to participate in as many events and workshops as possible, whether it's a hack session, tech talk, or jamming session. I'm down for impromptu coding challenges, networking, and bonding over our shared passion for data and tech. I'm excited to soak up new knowledge, try out new tools, and, most importantly, make some unforgettable memories! Hey everyone! I'm Sofía, and I'm beyond excited to be here at the datathon. As a sophomore, I've just dipped my toes into the world of coding, and I'm loving every minute of it. My friends would say I'm a total data enthusiast - I just can't get enough of it! I'm always on the lookout for new experiences, learning new tricks, and making new friends who share my passion. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to music or whipping up some art. Can't wait to meet you all and have some amazing times together!
