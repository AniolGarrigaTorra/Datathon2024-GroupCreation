Hey there! My objective for this datathon is crystal clear: I'm here to win. With my intermediate programming skills and experience in three hackathons under my belt, I'm confident in my abilities to tackle a tough challenge. I want to throw everything I've got at the problem and come out on top. I'm not looking to make friends (not that I wouldn't like to!), I'm not here to learn for the sake of learning (although, let's be real, I'll likely pick up some new tricks along the way). No, my main goal is to take home that trophy - and I'm ready to put in the work to get it. Hey there! I'm SÃ²nia Elena Foster, a second-year student on a mission to conquer the datathon! With a knack for combining tech and creativity, I've honed my skills in coding and AI. I thrive in fast-paced environments and love tackling complex problems. You might say I'm a perfectionist, and when it comes to competitions, I'm driven to come out on top. With a passion for innovation and a hunger to learn, I'm ready to unleash my full potential. Let's see what the next 24 hours bring - it's game on!
