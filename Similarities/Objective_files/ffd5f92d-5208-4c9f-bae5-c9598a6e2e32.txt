My objective for this datathon is to learn and improve my skills as much as possible. As an intermediate programmer, I'm eager to dive deeper into data analytics and exploration. I want to gain hands-on experience with new tools and techniques, and learn from experts in the field. My ultimate goal is to leave this event with a solid understanding of data visualization, machine learning, and data storytelling, and to have a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills. I'm looking forward to a challenging yet fulfilling experience! Hey there! I'm Anaïs Sofía Ingram, a 20-year-old student with a passion for learning and growth. I'm currently honing my coding skills, and I'm excited to take my data analysis skills to the next level at this datathon. I'm all about optimizing my workflow, making a positive impact, and staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends. I love exploring how technology can improve our daily lives and I'm looking forward to working with like-minded individuals to tackle complex problems. Let's geek out and crush some data challenges together!
