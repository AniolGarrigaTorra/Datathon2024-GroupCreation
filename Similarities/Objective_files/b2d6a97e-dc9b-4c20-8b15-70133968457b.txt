My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm looking to make some new friends, have a blast, and take in as much as I can from this awesome experience. I've done a few hackathons before, but I've always been too focused on the competition aspect to really soak up all the other goodness that's going on. This time around, I want to take a step back, have fun, and learn something new along the way. If I happen to win something or learn a cool new skill, that's just icing on the cake! Hey there! I'm Liam Thompson, a third-year student with a passion for innovation and collaboration. I've dabbled in a few hackathons before, but this time I'm looking forward to shedding my competitive jacket and focusing on the experience. When I'm not scribbling away at code, I enjoy dabbling in Fintech and Social Good projects. My friends might say I'm a curious bee, always buzzing from one new tech idea to the next. I'm all about learning, sharing knowledge, and having a blast - the datathon sounds like the perfect combination of fun and growth!
