I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere and making memories this datathon! For me, it's all about the connections I make and the fun I have. I'd love to collaborate with fellow datathoners on as many projects as I can, learn from their perspectives, and gain new experiences. I'm not about competing with others or stressing out over winning; I just want to be part of an awesome community, learn from the challenges, and enjoy the ride! Let's make some friends and create some unforgettable experiences! Hey there! I'm Emma Winters, a 20-year-old third-year student with a passion for using technology to make a positive impact. I'm all about collaboration and creativity, which is why I'm super stoked to be here for the datathon. I'm a firm believer that learning should be fun, and that's exactly what I'm hoping to do here. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me experimenting with new design tools or digging into code. I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere, making friends, and maybe even creating something amazing along the way. Let's make some memories!
