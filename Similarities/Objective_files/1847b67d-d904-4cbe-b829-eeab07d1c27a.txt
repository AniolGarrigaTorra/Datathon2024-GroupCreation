For me, datathon is all about having an amazing time with like-minded people! I'm excited to meet new folks, learn from them, and share my own knowledge. I want to participate in as many events as possible, whether it's a coding session, a workshop, or a party. I'm looking forward to making new friends who share my passion for data and tech, and enjoying the vibe of the event. I'm a 3rd-year student and I've had some decent experience with programming, so I'm hoping to refine my skills too. But above all, I want to have fun and make memories! Hey everyone! I'm Ariadna, and I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon. I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for anything tech-related. When I'm not hit the books, you can find me exploring the world of fintech and e-commerce, or trying to build the next big AR/VR experience. I love the idea of combining tech with human touch and making life easier for others. I'm looking forward to geeking out with all of you, sharing knowledge, and taking home some awesome memories. Let's get this party started!
