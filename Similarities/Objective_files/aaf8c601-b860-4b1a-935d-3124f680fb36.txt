Here's my objective for the datathon:

I'm all about the win! I'm a competitive person by nature, and I'm coming to the datathon to push myself to the limit to take home the prize. I'll be focusing on perfecting my programming skills, learning new techniques, and collaborating with teammates to produce a top-notch project. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready for the challenge and confident that with dedication and perseverance, I can bring home that win! Hey there! I'm Alessia, a 19-year-old coding enthusiast and 2nd-year student. I've got a passion for innovation and a competitive streak that drives me to push limits. When I'm not hitting the books, I love exploring the intersection of tech and real-life problems, trying to hack away at them with my limited but growing skills. I'm all about building connections and forming teams that will help me elevate my game and take on the best. So, let's get ready to rumble and crush this datathon together!
