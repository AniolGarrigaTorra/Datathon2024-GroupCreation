My objective for this datathon is to focus on leveling up my skills and taking away practical knowledge from this experience. I'm excited to dive into new technologies and challenge myself to learn and improve. I'm not too concerned with winning; I'm more interested in building upon my existing skills and learning from the other participants. I'd love to participate in workshops and coding sessions to pick up new tricks and approaches, and see how I can apply them to real-world problems. Bring on the learning adventure! Hi, I'm Elisabetta! I'm a 21-year-old student, currently in my third year of studies. I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! I've got a passion for combining technology with real-world problems, and I'm all about leveling up my skills. I've had some experience with coding, but I'm still growing and learning. I love exploring new technologies and finding creative ways to apply them to practical projects. For me, this datathon is all about being part of a supportive community, learning new tricks, and having a blast while we code.
