Hey there! As Astrid, my objective for this datathon is all about soaking up the experience and making some unforgettable memories. I want to connect with like-minded folks, learn from their experiences, and share some laughs together. I'm more about having fun and participating in a variety of activities rather than focusing solely on winning. I'm all about embracing the vibe, trying new things, and growing as a person. I'm excited to meet new people, participate in workshops, and explore the city during the datathon - it's going to be an amazing adventure! Hey there! I'm Astrid, a curious and adventurous third-year student. I'm always up for a good time and a new experience. In my free time, I love to dabble in tech, especially exploring AR/VR and learning about new trends in Fintech. I'm excited to join the datathon, where I can meet others who share my passion for innovation and learning. I'm more interested in building connections and trying new things than winning, and I'm looking forward to a memorable experience!
