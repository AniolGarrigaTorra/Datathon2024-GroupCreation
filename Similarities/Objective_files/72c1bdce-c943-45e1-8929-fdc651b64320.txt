Hello! My objective for this datathon is to give it my all and strive for victory. As a competitive and driven individual, I want to push myself to the limits of my skills and come out on top. I've been in this game for a while now, having participated in four hackathons, and I'm confident in my abilities. This datathon is an opportunity for me to test my mettle and come out on top. I'm not looking for a casual experience; I'm here to compete and win, and I'm willing to put in the hard work to make it happen. Hey, I'm Aur√©lie! A third-year student with a passion for innovation and competition. I've participated in four hackathons, and I'm fueled by the thrill of solving real-world problems and beating the clock. I'm a bit of a nerd, with a penchant for coding and design, but I also believe that with great power comes great responsibility - I'm driven by a desire to create solutions that make a positive impact. For this datathon, I'm aiming to push myself to the limit and strive for victory - bring it on!
