As someone who's always eager to level up my skills, my objective for this datathon is to learn as much as I can and come out of this experience with a newfound expertise. I'm excited to dive into new technologies and explore their applications in real-world scenarios. My goal is to take away practical knowledge, not just a trophy or a winning prize. I want to refine my coding skills, learn from others, and develop a stronger portfolio to enhance my prospects as a data enthusiast. Bring on the coding challenges, I'm ready to learn! Hey everyone! I'm Ava Sierra Rodriguez, and I'm super excited to be here for the datathon. I'm a 19-year-old student, and programming is my new favorite thing. Okay, maybe new favorite is an understatement - I'm obsessed! I'm all about staying ahead of the curve, and this datathon is my chance to do just that. I'm looking forward to diving into new tech, learning from others, and coming out with some serious skills to add to my portfolio. So, let's do this!
