I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon! My objective is to learn as much as I can from the expert judges and mentors, and to level up my skills in data analysis and visualization. I've had a decent amount of experience with hackathons, but I know there's always room for improvement, and I'm excited to dive deep into the challenges and exercises they'll be presenting. My goal is to take home some new ideas and techniques to enhance my skills and maybe even find a new passion area. Wish me luck! Hey, I'm Isabella! I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I've had a taste of hackathons before, but I'm excited to dive deeper into data analysis and visualization this time. I'm looking forward to learning from expert judges and mentors and exploring new areas to improve my skills. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me reading about lifehacks and trying to optimize my productivity. I'm excited to challenge myself and potentially discover new areas that spark my interest.
