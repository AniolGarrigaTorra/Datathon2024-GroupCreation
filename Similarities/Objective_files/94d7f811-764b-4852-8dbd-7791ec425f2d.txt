Hey, I'm Aurélia! I'm all about bringing my A-game to this datathon. My objective is simple: to WIN. I've participated in two hackathons before and learned some valuable skills, but this time I'm looking to take it to the next level. I want to challenge myself, push my limits, and prove to myself that I can deliver a standout project. If that means putting in late nights, learning new technologies, and fine-tuning my code, then so be it. I'm ready to put in the hard work to take home the top prize! Hey there! I'm Aurélia, a 18-year-old second-year student who's all about making an impact in the tech world. With a passion for innovation and a track record of taking on new challenges, I'm super excited to be here at the datathon. My goal is to push myself to the limit and create something truly remarkable. I've learned a thing or two from past hackathons, and now I'm ready to take it to the next level. Get ready for some serious coding marathons, intense brainstorming sessions, and lots of fun along the way!
