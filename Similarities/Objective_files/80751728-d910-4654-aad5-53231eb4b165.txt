Hi! As a student, I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to make the most of this experience by having a blast and making new friends along the way. I'm hoping to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, participate in as many events as possible, and learn from everyone's expertise while having a laugh. I'm all about having fun, sharing knowledge, and building those awesome datathon vibes! Let's rock this! Hey everyone! I'm Eva, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon! As a 2nd-year student, I'm looking to level up my data game and have an amazing time with fellow enthusiasts. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me geeking out over Fintech and Enterprise stuff. I'm all about learning from others and sharing knowledge. I'm a big believer that data should be fun, so I'm here to bring some much-needed enthusiasm to the competition. Let's get this party started and make some unforgettable memories!
