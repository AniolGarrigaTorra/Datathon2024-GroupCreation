My objective for this datathon is to make the most of my experience and have an absolute blast! I'm looking forward to meeting new people, learning from their perspectives, and making some amazing memories along the way. I'm not so much concerned about winning or competing; instead, I want to participate in as many events as I can, stay curious, and soak up as much knowledge as possible. My goal is to leave here with a bunch of new friends, an expanded network, and a sense of fulfillment that comes with having tried something new and enjoyed every moment of it! Hey there! I'm Ava Riley, a 22-year-old student with a passion for coding and design. I'm currently in my fourth year, and I'm excited to dive into this datathon experience. I'm a curious learner with an eye for innovation and a love for making things work. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me exploring the world of blockchain and enterprise technology. I'm all about embracing challenges, collaborating with others, and having a blast along the way. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you and seeing what the week has in store!
