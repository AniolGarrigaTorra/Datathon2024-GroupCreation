I'm Anna, and my objective for this datathon is to use it as a chance to level up my programming skills and learn new things. I'm always looking for ways to improve my coding and problem-solving abilities, and I'm excited to be surrounded by other enthusiastic learners and mentors. My goal is to push myself outside of my comfort zone, take on new challenges, and come away with fresh perspectives and techniques to apply to my studies and future projects. I'm looking forward to the chance to learn from my peers and mentors and to grow as a developer. Hey everyone, I'm Anna Maria Sol√†! I'm a 20-year-old student in my second year of studying computer science. I'm super excited to be here for this datathon, as it's the perfect opportunity for me to level up my programming skills and tackle new challenges. I'm passionate about problem-solving and always look for ways to improve my coding abilities. In my free time, I enjoy delving into the world of AI, voice assistants, and anything that combines technology with art. I'm eager to meet and learn from like-minded individuals, and I'm looking forward to making some amazing connections and having a blast along the way!
