Here's my objective:

I'm all about making the most of this datathon experience! I want to connect with fellow participants, build new friendships, and have an absolute blast while doing it. I'm not super competitive, so you won't find me obsessing over the top prize. Instead, I'm looking forward to exploring new tech trends, trying out different challenges, and enjoying the fun events the datathon has to offer. Bring on the ping-pong tournaments and team-building exercises - I'm ready to make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Aurélie Rae Valdés, a 22-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. I've always been fascinated by the way code can bring ideas to life. When I'm not busy with studies, you can find me tinkering with apps, exploring new technologies, or attempting to bake the perfect cake. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon, looking forward to making friends and having a blast with fellow enthusiasts. Let's grab some coding coffee and make some unforgettable memories together!
