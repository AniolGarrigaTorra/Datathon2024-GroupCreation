I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! For me, it's all about having an amazing time and making new friends. I've had a blast at previous hackathons, but sometimes the competition gets in the way. This time, I just want to chill, learn from others, and participate in all the fun events - from workshops to social gatherings. I'm not super bothered about winning or topping the leaderboards (although, who knows, maybe I'll surprise everyone). I just want to laugh, connect with like-minded folks, and take home some awesome memories. Hey everyone! I'm Sofia Ribas, a 21-year-old student with a passion for learning and collaborating. When I'm not in class, I love tinkering with new technologies and exploring innovative ways to make a difference. This datathon is the perfect opportunity for me to combine fun with learning, and make new friends who share my interests. I'm all about embracing the 'datathon vibe' and experiencing the thrill of working with like-minded individuals. So, let's have some amazing time, create something awesome, and make memories that'll last a lifetime!
