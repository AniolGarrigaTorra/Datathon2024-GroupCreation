My objective for this datathon is to have an awesome time with fellow data enthusiasts! I'm excited to meet new people, learn from their experiences, and share my own knowledge and passion for programming. I'm not too concerned about winning or losing, I just want to engage in all the fun events, attend cool workshops, and make some meaningful connections. I believe that even though we're all there for the same purpose, the vibe should be relaxed and social, so I'm looking forward to making new friends and having a blast! Hey there! I'm Ashley Winston, a 23-year-old Master's student by day and a coding enthusiast by night. I'm all about pursuing the intersection of technology and social impact. With a passion for data and analytics, I'm excited to dive into the datathon and learn from fellow minds. I'm not a competitive person, so for me, it's all about the experience - meeting new people, sharing knowledge, and having a blast! Outside of coding, I'm a creative at heart, with a love for music, art, and lifehacks. See you around the datathon!
