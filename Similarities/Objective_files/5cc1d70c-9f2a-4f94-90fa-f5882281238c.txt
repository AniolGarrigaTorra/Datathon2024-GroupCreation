My objective for this datathon is to dive deep into learning and skill-building! As a sophomore with intermediate programming experience, I'm excited to challenge myself and push my boundaries. I'm hoping to pick up new tools, frameworks, and methodologies that will help me grow both professionally and personally. I'd love to be part of collaborations, get feedback from mentors, and work on projects that push my comfort zone. By the end of this datathon, I hope to have gained valuable knowledge and insights that I can apply to my future projects and enhance my skills. Bring it on! Hey there!
