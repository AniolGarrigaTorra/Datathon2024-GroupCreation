My objective for this datathon is to soak up every moment and make the most of this experience. I want to connect with like-minded individuals, learn from their perspectives and approaches, and just have a blast! I'm not in it to win it (although that would be awesome too,. Instead, I'm all about networking, participating in all the cool events, and having unforgettable memories. Bring on the pizza, games, and coding sprints - I'm ready to make the most of this datathon adventure! Hey everyone! I'm Anna, a second-year student with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. I've been messing around with coding since high school and now I'm exploring the wonderful world of DevOps and Blockchain. Outside of coding, you can find me at a music gig or creating art. I'm all about making connections, sharing ideas, and having a great time! For this datathon, I'm looking forward to collaboration, learning from others, and making unforgettable memories. I'm excited to see where this adventure takes us!
