Honestly, my objective is straightforward - I want to crush it and win this datathon! As a 1st-year student, I'm eager to challenge myself and prove that I've got what it takes. I've been itching to put my beginner-level coding skills to the test, and what better way to do that than in a competitive setting? I'm prepared to spend long hours, think creatively, and collaborate with my teammates to come up with innovative solutions. Bring it on - I'm ready to go all out and take home the prize! Hey there! I'm Emily Rachel Jenkins, a 19-year-old freshman in computer science. I'm super eager to crush this datathon and prove myself as a force to be reckoned with, even as a beginner. I've got a passion for using tech to drive positive change, and I'm excited to share that with the team. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with life hacks or exploring the intersection of education and technology. I'm ready to dive headfirst into this competition and learn as much as I can along the way!
