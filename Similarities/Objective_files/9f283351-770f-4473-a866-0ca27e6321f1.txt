My objective for this datathon is to learn new tricks and sharpen my skills in data analysis and programming. I'm not here to be a sore winner or worry about coming in first place, I'm all about personal growth. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone, tackle new challenges, and walk away from this datathon with a solid understanding of new tools and techniques. My ultimate goal is to level up my skills and knowledge, so I can tackle real-world problems with confidence and enthusiasm. Let the learning begin! Hey there! I'm Aurora Elena Sanchez, a 20-year-old student on a quest for coding greatness. I've got a solid foundation in programming and a passion for innovation. When I'm not busy with my studies, you can find me dabbling in Fintech, Web development, or Machine Learning. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm excited to level up my skills during this datathon. I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges, meeting like-minded individuals, and pushing my comfort zone. Let's make some awesome data together!
