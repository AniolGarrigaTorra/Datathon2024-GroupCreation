My objective for this datathon is to dig deeper into my programming skills and explore new tools and technologies. As a 3rd-year student with intermediate experience, I'm eager to challenge myself and gain practical knowledge that will enhance my degree. I'm not here to win at all costs, but rather to learn from others, attend workshops, and take on projects that push my limits. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow participants, ask questions, and grow as a programmer. By the end of this datathon, I hope to have a newfound confidence in my skills and a fresh perspective on my degree. Hey there! I'm SÃ²nia, a third-year student with a passion for exploring new programming technologies and collaborating with others to create innovative projects. I've gained some intermediate experience in programming, and I'm looking to push myself further during this datathon. My academic background in software engineering has given me a solid foundation, but I'm eager to dig deeper into practical applications and real-world challenges. I'm excited to learn from fellow participants, share my own experiences, and develop my skills in a dynamic and supportive environment.
