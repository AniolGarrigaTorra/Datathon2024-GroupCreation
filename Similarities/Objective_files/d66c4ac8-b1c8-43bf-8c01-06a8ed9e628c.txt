Hey, I'm super excited to be part of this datathon! As a fun-loving data enthusiast, my goal is to soak up as many new experiences as possible. I'm looking forward to networking with fellow participants, learning from their expertise, and maybe even picking up a new skill or two along the way. I want to participate in as many events and activities as I can, from coding challenges to workshops and even maybe some spontaneous data jams. It's all about having a blast with my fellow hackers and coming out of this weekend feeling inspired and more connected in the data community! Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a curious and adventurous data enthusiast. I'm a second-year student with a passion for uncovering hidden patterns and telling stories through data. I'm always looking for ways to combine my love of tech and art, and I'm fascinated by the latest developments in AI and Quantum. Outside of academics, you can find me jamming to music, creating digital art, or fiddling with the latest gadgets. I'm stoked to be here at the datathon and can't wait to geek out with like-minded folks! Let's hack, learn, and have some fun!
