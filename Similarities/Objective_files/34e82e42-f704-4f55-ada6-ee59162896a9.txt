As I'm diving into this datathon, my main objective is to soak up as much knowledge as possible and continually improve my skills in programming. I'm eager to challenge myself and experiment with new concepts, languages, and tools. I want to walk away from this event with a stronger foundation, new ideas, and a fresh perspective. I'm open to feedback, willing to learn from others, and excited to see what I can achieve in a short amount of time. Let's get hacking and see where this adventure takes me! Hey there! I'm Alexa Santana MÃ¼ller, a second-year student with a passion for tech and learning. As a curious and driven individual, I'm always looking for new challenges to help me grow. My interest in cybersecurity and AI led me to dabble in IoT, blockchain, and machine learning. When I'm not geeking out over code, I enjoy designing and prototyping innovative ideas. I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon, where I can dive deeper into new concepts, collaborate with others, and refine my skills. Let's hack, experiment, and create something amazing together!
