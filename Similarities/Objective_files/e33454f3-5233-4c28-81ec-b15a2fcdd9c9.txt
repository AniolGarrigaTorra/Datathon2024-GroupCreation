Hey! My objective for this datathon is to make the most of this awesome experience by having a blast with fellow participants. I want to take part in as many events and activities as possible, learn new skills, and meet new people who share my passions. I'm not as much about competing and winning, but more about enjoying the ride, networking, and creating lasting memories with like-minded folks. Can't wait to soak up the energy and make new friends along the way! Hey, I'm Sol! A 21-year-old student with a passion for creating cool stuff with code. I'm all about dev, data, and making connections. I'm currently working on developing my skills in programming and AI, and I love experimenting with new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying out new food spots or attending meetups. I'm all about making memories and networking, not just about winning or losing. I'm super stoked to be here at the datathon, ready to take part in some awesome events and make new friends along the way!
