Hi! So, my objective for this datathon is all about growth for me. I'm really looking to challenge myself, learn from others, and expand my skill set. I'm hoping to get exposed to new technologies, tools, and approaches that can help me level up my programming skills. I'm excited to work on projects that push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to take on new responsibilities. I'd love to collaborate with other participants and get feedback from experienced mentors to help me improve. Hey there! I'm Livia Enrica Flynn, a 20-year-old undergraduate with a passion for solving problems and learning new things. I've had some experience with programming, mostly in the realm of computer vision and game development, and I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself. For this datathon, I'm excited to dive into new technologies, work on innovative projects, and meet fellow coders and mentors who can help me grow as a developer. I'm all about leveling up and expanding my skills, and I can't wait to see what the next 48 hours bring!
