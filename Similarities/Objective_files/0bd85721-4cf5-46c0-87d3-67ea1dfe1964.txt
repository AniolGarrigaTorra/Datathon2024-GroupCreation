Hey there! So, I'm Sophia and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! My objective is to soak up the experience and make the most of it. I want to meet new people, have a blast, and attend as many workshops and events as possible. I'm not too focused on winning - I'd rather learn some new skills, enjoy the vibes, and share laughs with fellow participants. It's gonna be an awesome weekend, and I'm excited to see what adventures we'll create! Hey there! I'm Sophia, and I'm beyond excited to be here at the datathon! As a first-year student, I'm still learning the ropes, but I'm already passionate about combining my love for design with the power of tech. I've dabbled in programming, and I'm looking forward to soaking up as much as I can over the weekend. With my fingers on the pulse of innovation, I'm all about creative collaboration and having an amazing time. I'm ready to meet fellow adventurers, learn from each other, and leave with unforgettable experiences. Let's make this an unforgettable weekend!
