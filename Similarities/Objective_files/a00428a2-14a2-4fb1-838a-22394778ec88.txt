For me, this datathon is all about leveling up my skills. As a third-year student, I'm looking to dive deeper into data analysis and visualization, and this is the perfect opportunity to learn from industry experts and get hands-on experience. My goal is to take what I learn here and apply it to my final year project, so I can walk away with some concrete skills that I can use in my future career. I'm not too fussed about the competition, but I am excited to challenge myself and come away feeling more confident in my abilities. Hey everyone!
