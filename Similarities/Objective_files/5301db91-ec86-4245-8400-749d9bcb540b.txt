I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! As someone who's relatively new to coding, I'm looking to upskill and refine my skills in programming and data analysis. I'm eager to learn from others, absorb new knowledge, and take on challenges that'll push me outside of my comfort zone. I hope to come out of this with fresh ideas, improved problem-solving techniques, and a sense of accomplishment. By the end of this datathon, I want to feel confident in my abilities and be able to tackle more complex projects. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Alessandra, a second-year student looking to take my coding skills to the next level. I'm super excited to be part of this datathon and learn from amazing minds. I've always been fascinated by the way technology can transform the world, from smart homes to automation. My passion for programming has grown rapidly over the past year, and I'm eager to dive into new challenges. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, getting out of my comfort zone, and walking away with fresh ideas and a sense of accomplishment. Let's do this!
