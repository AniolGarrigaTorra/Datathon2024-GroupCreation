I'm excited to join this datathon with a goal to level up my skills and learn as much as I can from this experience. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I always learn something new and valuable from them. I'm looking to challenge myself and take on new challenges, even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone. I hope to improve my data analysis and visualization skills, and explore different libraries and tools to enhance my coding capabilities. Let's see what this datathon has in store for me and what I can take away from it! Hi there! I'm Luisa Wagner, a 20-year-old student passionate about technology and innovation. I've dabbled in programming for a while now, and I'm always up for a challenge. I've participated in hackathons before, and I love how they push me out of my comfort zone. When I'm not stuck in a lecture hall, I enjoy exploring the latest design trends, robotics, and voice-assisted tech. My goal for this datathon is to upskill and take on new challenges, even if it means venturing into uncharted territory. I'm excited to learn from fellow participants and mentors, and who knows, maybe take home some sweet prizes!
