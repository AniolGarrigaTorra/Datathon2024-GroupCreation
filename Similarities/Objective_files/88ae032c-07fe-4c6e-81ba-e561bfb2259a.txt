I'm super excited to dive into this datathon and take my skills to the next level! My objective is to come away from this experience with a solid understanding of new techniques, concepts, and tools. I'm looking to improve my coding abilities, learn from others, and push myself outside of my comfort zone. I'm eager to work on a project that challenges me and helps me grow as a developer. I'm willing to put in the effort to learn, collaborate, and receive feedback - I'm ready to level up my skills and take on new projects! Hey there! I'm Pilar Fleurier, an 18-year-old student jumping into my first datathon. I'm a music enthusiast and art lover, but when I'm not jamming out to my fave tunes or creating something visually stunning, I'm a coding enthusiast! With a background in beginner-level programming, I'm looking to level up my skills and learn new techniques. I'm eager to dive into this competition and take on a challenge that pushes me outside of my comfort zone. Can't wait to meet fellow coders and learn from each other's experiences!
