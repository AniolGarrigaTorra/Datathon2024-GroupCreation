For me, this datathon is all about making new friends and having a blast! I'm excited to meet other like-minded individuals, learn from them, and share my own experiences. I'm looking forward to participating in as many events as possible, from workshops to competitions, and soaking up as much fun as I can. My goal is to walk away from this weekend with a fresh perspective, some amazing new friends, and an unforgettable memory. Hey there! I'm Aurora Sofia Jennings, a 21-year-old student on a mission to create unforgettable experiences. As a curious and creative individual, I'm always up for a challenge and thrive in environments that encourage collaboration and innovation. With a passion for solving real-world problems through technology, I'm excited to join this datathon and share my enthusiasm with like-minded friends. Let's build something amazing together, have a blast, and make memories that will last a lifetime!
