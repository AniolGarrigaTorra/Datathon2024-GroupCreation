My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm here to win. As a competitive problem-solver, I thrive under pressure and am driven by the pursuit of excellence. I've got a solid foundation in programming from my studies, and two hackathons under my belt, so I'm eager to put my skills to the test. My goal is to outdo my fellow competitors, learn from them, and come out on top. I'm in it to win it, and I won't hold back. Hi there! I'm Aur√®lia Fleming, a fourth-year student with a passion for problem-solving. When I'm not busy hitting the books, I'm usually dabbling in design, coding, or dreaming up new ways to use technology for good. I thrive in competitive environments and love the rush of solving complex puzzles under pressure. With two hackathons under my belt, I'm no stranger to the thrill of innovation. My goal here is to outdo myself and come out on top. Let's get this datathon started and see who comes out on top!
