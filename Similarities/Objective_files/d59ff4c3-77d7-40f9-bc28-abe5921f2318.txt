Hey, it's me, Aurélia! For this datathon, my objective is straightforward: I'm here to level up my skills and learn as much as I can. I've only been programming for a bit over a year, and I'm eager to dive deeper into data analysis and visualization. I'm hoping to take some online courses or workshops to improve my Python skills and get familiar with new tools and technologies. I'm all about self-improvement, so I'd love to come out of this datathon feeling more confident and competent in my abilities. Let's do this! Hey there!
