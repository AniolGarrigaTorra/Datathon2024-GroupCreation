Hey, I'm Eve! My main objective for this datathon is to soak up the vibe, make some new buddies, and have an absolute blast! I'm all about fostering an amazing community, so I'm planning to attend as many events as I can, engage in some awesome workshops, and collaborate with folks on some creative projects. For me, datathons are all about the friendships, the memories, and the fun experiences - I'm super stoked to be a part of this amazing event! See you around! Hi there! I'm Eve Watts, a 22-year-old student with a passion for innovation. I'm thrilled to be part of this datathon! Outside of academics, I love exploring the intersection of art and tech. When I'm not programming away, you can find me jamming out to music or trying out new recipes. I'm all about creating a fun and inclusive environment, and I'm stoked to collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts. I'm looking forward to soaking up the vibes, learning from others, and making some amazing memories. Let's make this datathon an unforgettable experience!
