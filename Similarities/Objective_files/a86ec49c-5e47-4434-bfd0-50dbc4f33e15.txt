As I step into this datathon, my main goal is to dive headfirst into the world of data exploration and skills development. I'm excited to challenge myself and learn new tricks, algorithms, and tools that'll take my programming skills to the next level. I'm looking forward to pushing my limits, experimenting with novel approaches, and refining my problem-solving strategies. My ultimate aim is to emerge from this event as a more confident and skilled programmer, with a fresh perspective and a newfound appreciation for the ever-evolving world of data science. Hey there! I'm Evelyn, a 21-year-old student with a passion for making a difference through code. I'm all about leveraging technology to drive social good and promote education. When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me jamming out to music or experimenting with art. I'm excited to bring my curious mindset and enthusiasm to this datathon and learn from the best. With a background in programming, I'm looking forward to leveling up my skills and taking on new challenges - ready to push myself and come out stronger on the other side!
