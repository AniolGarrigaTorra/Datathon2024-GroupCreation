I'm excited to participate in this datathon to really level up my skills. As a beginner in programming, I feel like I still have so much to learn, and this event is the perfect opportunity for me to dive deeper into data science. My goal is to get hands-on experience with new tools and techniques, and to push myself out of my comfort zone. I'm not necessarily aiming for the top prize, but I'm hoping to walk away with a stronger foundation in data analysis and a renewed sense of motivation to keep honing my craft. Hi there! I'm Sofia Nadal, an 18-year-old student eager to make my mark in the world of data science. Although I'm still in my first year, I've got a fire in my belly to learn and grow. I'm excited to take part in this datathon, not just to boost my skills, but to challenge myself and push beyond my comfort zone. I'm all about getting hands-on with new tools and techniques, and making sense of data to uncover hidden insights. Can't wait to meet you all and learn from each other's perspectives!
