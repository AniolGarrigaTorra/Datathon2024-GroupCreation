I'm looking forward to creating unforgettable memories, making new friends, and sharing laughs over the next few days. It's time to party, learn, and grow with a community that shares my passions! Hi everyone! I'm Ana√Øs, a 21-year-old student with a passion for lifehacks, design, and making connections. I'm an adventure-seeker at heart, always looking for new challenges and ways to learn. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming with friends or exploring the world of coding. I'm here to dive head-first into this datathon, absorb the atmosphere, and meet amazing people like yourselves. Let's create unforgettable memories and share in the excitement together!
