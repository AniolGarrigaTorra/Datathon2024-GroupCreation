Here's my objective: My main goal for this datathon is to give it my all and crush the competition. I'm not looking to have a chill experience or learn a million new things (although those might happen too). What gets me pumped is the thrill of the win. I want to dive headfirst into the challenge, focus my energy on solving the problems, and be one of the top few teams standing at the end. That sounds like a crazy-awesometime to me! Hey! I'm Sophie, an 18-year-old student looking to bring the heat to this datathon. With a passion for education and innovation, I'm all about pushing the boundaries and achieving the impossible. My experience in programming has equipped me with the skills to take on anything that comes my way. I thrive under pressure, and my motto is to dive headfirst into the challenge and give it my all. When I'm not programming, you can find me rocking out to my favorite tunes or exploring the world of virtual reality. Bring on the datathon, I'm ready to take on the competition!
