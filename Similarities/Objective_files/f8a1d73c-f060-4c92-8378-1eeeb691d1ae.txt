Hey! I'm Sophie, and for this datathon, I'm all about leveling up my skills and knowledge. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm excited to dive into new tools, technologies, and approaches to become a more well-rounded developer. My goal is to challenge myself and come out of this event with a tangible project, improved coding chops, and a newfound confidence in my abilities. Let's learn, code, and grow together - no prizes needed! Hi! I'm Sophie, a 20-year-old student fueled by curiosity and passion for tech.
