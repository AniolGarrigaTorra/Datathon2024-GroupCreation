My objective is to have a blast at this datathon! I'm all about meeting new people, making friends, and having fun while learning. I don't really care about the winning part, I just want to dive in and get my hands dirty with some cool projects. I'm excited to participate in as many events and workshops as possible, learn new skills, and share my own knowledge with others. At the end of it all, I hope to leave with some awesome stories, new contacts, and a ton of unforgettable memories! Hi there! I'm Laia, an 18-year-old student who's super excited to be here at the datathon! I'm in my second year of studying and love experimenting with code in my free time. When I'm not diving into projects, I'm often brainstorming ideas for improving education and social good through tech. I'm all about collaboration and learning from others, so this event is the perfect place for me to share my passions and absorb new ones. I'm looking forward to meeting new people, attending workshops, and, most importantly, having a blast with fellow coding enthusiasts!
