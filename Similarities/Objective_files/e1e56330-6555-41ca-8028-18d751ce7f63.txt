Hey! I'm Emily. For this datathon, my objective is all about having a blast with fellow participants! I'm super excited to mingle with new people, participate in as many events as I can, and learn from others while having fun. I'm not too stressed about winning, as I've had some experience with hackathons before and would love to focus on the social side of things. I'm hoping to make some awesome friends, enjoy some cool talks and workshops, and make this a datathon to remember! Hey there! I'm Emily, a 21-year-old fourth-year student who's super excited to be here at the datathon. As a tech enthusiast, I love exploring the intersection of innovation and design, from crafting user-friendly interfaces to building intelligent systems. When I'm not buried in code, you can find me chatting with friends or scoping out the latest lifehack trends. I'm all about making the most of this event, meeting new folks, and having a blast while doing it. Let's get this party started!
