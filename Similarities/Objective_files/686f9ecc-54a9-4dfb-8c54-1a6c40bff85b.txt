For me, this datathon is an opportunity to deepen my understanding of programming and data analysis. I'm looking to step out of my comfort zone and learn new skills, whether it's exploring a new language, working with unfamiliar datasets, or tackling a new problem domain. I'm eager to challenge myself and absorb as much as I can from this experience. My goal is to walk away from this datathon with a broader set of skills and confidence in my abilities, so that I can tackle future projects and challenges with more gusto. Hi, I'm Ada Fontan√®s-Pierre! I'm a 20-year-old student with a passion for using code to make a difference. I've been dabbling in programming for a while now, and I'm excited to take my skills to the next level at this datathon. I'm looking forward to stepping out of my comfort zone and learning new skills - whether it's exploring a new language, tackling a new problem domain, or working with unfamiliar datasets. My goal is to come out of this experience with a newfound confidence in my abilities and a broader toolkit to tackle future projects.
