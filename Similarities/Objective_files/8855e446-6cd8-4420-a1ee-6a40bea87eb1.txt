I'm excited to be a part of this datathon, and my goal is to make new friends, have fun, and participate in as many events as possible. I'm all about people over programming (even though I'm learning some new skills too)! I'm looking forward to bonding with fellow datathoners, discovering hidden talents, and laughing with like-minded folks. Bring on the games, workshops, and after-parties - I'm ready to make some unforgettable memories. No pressure, just pure datathon vibes for me! Hey there! I'm SÃ²nia, a 21-year-old student always up for a good time. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me tinkering with code or geeking out over AI/ML. I love discovering new tech trends and making friends along the way. For me, datathons are all about the vibes - people over programming, laughter over algorithms, and adventures over APIs. I'm stoked to be here, ready to soak up knowledge, create unforgettable memories, and maybe, just maybe, learn a thing or two. Who knows, maybe you'll be the one introducing me to my next favorite tech stack?
