My goal for this datathon is all about having a blast and meeting new people. I'm excited to participate in as many events and activities as I can, learn something new, and make lasting connections with fellow participants. I'm a people person and I love making new friends, so this datathon is the perfect opportunity to do that. I'm not too concerned about winning, as I'm still learning and growing as a programmer. I just want to have fun, be part of the datathon community, and take away some valuable memories and skills. Let's get this party started! Hey everyone! I'm Ashley Reed, a 17-year-old student with a passion for learning and exploration. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon and I'm looking forward to meeting all of you! As a first-year student, I'm eager to expand my horizons and learn as much as I can. I love connecting with like-minded people and building new friendships. In my free time, I enjoy diving into new tech trends and finding ways to make my daily life more efficient. Let's make this datathon an unforgettable experience together!
