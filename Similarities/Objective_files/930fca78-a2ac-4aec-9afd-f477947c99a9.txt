Hey! My main goal for this datathon is to immerse myself in new data-driven challenges and continue to level up my skills. I'm excited to dive into real-world problems and learn from others who share my passion for coding. I hope to leave this event feeling inspired and equipped with fresh ideas and techniques to incorporate into my studies and future projects. Of course, making connections and having fun with fellow participants is a bonus - but my primary focus is on personal growth and skill-building. Let's see what this datathon brings! Hey there! I'm Sof√≠a, a 21-year-old student with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm in my third year of studying, and I'm all about exploring new opportunities to level up my skills. I'm excited to dive into data-driven challenges and learn from others who share my enthusiasm for coding. When I'm not studying, you can find me experimenting with different programming languages and technologies, or brainstorming new ideas for apps and projects. I'm looking forward to meeting fellow enthusiasts and taking my skills to the next level at this datathon!
