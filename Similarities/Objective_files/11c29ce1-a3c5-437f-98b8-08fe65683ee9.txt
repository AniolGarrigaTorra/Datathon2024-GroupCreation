Hey there! I'm Alexandra Elena Moreno, and my goal for this datathon is simple - I'm here to win. With 5 hackathons under my belt and 2 years of programming experience, I'm confident in my skills, and I'm ready to push myself to the limit to take home the top prize. I'm all about learning from my mistakes and finding the most efficient solutions, and I'm willing to put in the extra effort to stay ahead of the competition. Bring on the challenges, and let's get ready to crunch some numbers! Hi! I'm Alexandra, an 18-year-old student with a passion for coding and creative problem-solving. I've dived headfirst into several hackathons, learning from my mistakes and perfecting my skills. With a background in music and art, I love combining technical skills with artistic expression. When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with AR/VR ideas or searching for the next social good initiative to work on. My focus is on efficiency, adaptability, and having fun - and I'm thrilled to be here, ready to take on this datathon and give it my all!
