My objective for this datathon is simple: I'm in it to win it. I've had a taste of competitive programming through previous hackathons and I'm hooked. I want to put my skills to the test, crunching numbers, and building something impressive that'll catch the judges' attention. I'll be focused, dedicated, and driven to deliver the best possible solution. Expect me to be typing away for hours, testing, and iterating tirelessly to get every line of code just right. Bring on the challenge! Hey there! I'm Eva, a 20-year-old student and code enthusiast. I've been hooked on competitive programming since my first hackathon experience, and I'm excited to be here to take on the datathon challenge. When I'm not devouring programming books or attending coding meetups, you can find me jamming to some tunes or curating my favorite digital art pieces. I'm all about pushing my skills to the limit and creating something awesome. I'm ready to get my coding ninja mask on and take on this challenge head-on. Let's make this an unforgettable datathon!
