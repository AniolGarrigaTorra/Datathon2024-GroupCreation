As Aurélien English, my main objective for this datathon is to make the most of this awesome experience. I'm all about creating connections and friendships with like-minded people, learning from one another, and having a blast while doing it. My goal is to participate in as many events and challenges as I can, soaking up new knowledge and gaining different perspectives. I'm not focusing on winning first prize, but rather enjoying the thrill of being part of a community, sharing ideas, and making memories with my new friends-to-be. Hey there! I'm Aurélien, a 22-year-old university student with a passion for connecting with fellow enthusiasts and building lasting friendships. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, where I hope to grow both personally and professionally. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me gaming or tinkering with the latest mobile tech. I'm all about learning from others and sharing my own insights, so let's grab some inspiration together and create some unforgettable memories!
