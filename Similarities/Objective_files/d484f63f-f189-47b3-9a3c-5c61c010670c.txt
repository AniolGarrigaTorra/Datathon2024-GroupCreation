My ultimate goal for this datathon is to crush it and come out on top! I'm not here to make friends (although, who knows, that might happen anyway!) or learn new skills (which is awesome, but not my priority here). My focus is on competing at the highest level and taking home the win. I'm a seasoned pro at hackathons, with one under my belt already, and I'm ready to use my skills to outdo my competitors and snag that first-place prize. Bring it on! Hey, I'm Sofia Garc√≠a! I'm a 21-year-old student with a passion for coding and a competitive streak a mile wide. With a solid foundation in programming, I've already taken on a hackathon and come out swinging. My ultimate goal is to dominate this datathon and take home that prize. I'm not here to make friends or learn new tricks (although, who knows, I might just find some new talent buddies?!) - I'm here to crush it and outdo the competition. Bring it on, and get ready for a fight to the finish!
