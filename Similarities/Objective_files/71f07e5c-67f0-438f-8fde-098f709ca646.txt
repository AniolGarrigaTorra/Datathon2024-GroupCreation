My goal for this datathon is to put all my energy into competing and doing my absolute best to win. I'm always been a competitive person and love the thrill of trying to come out on top. With this datathon being my first experience, I'm eager to push myself to learn as much as possible and bring home the prize. I'm not worried about making friends (although that would be cool too!), but I'm all about taking on the challenge and showcasing my skills. I'm ready to pour my heart and soul into this datathon and make it a competition to remember! Hey there! I'm Sara, a 17-year-old undergrad student with a passion for learning and competition. I'm diving into my first datathon, and I'm all about giving it my all and going for the win. I've always loved pushing myself to be the best, and this seems like the perfect opportunity to showcase my skills. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and staying on top of the latest innovations. I'm excited to meet you and take on the challenge - let's make this datathon unforgettable!
