My objective for this datathon is to soak up the vibes and have an amazing time! I want to meet new people who share similar interests and make some unforgettable memories with them. I'm not too fussed about the competition aspect, I just want to participate in as many events as I can, learn from others, and bring back some sweet insights to my projects back at university. I'm looking forward to discovering new skills and perspectives while having fun - see you at the datathon, friends! Hey there! I'm Merc√®, a curious 19-year-old student on a quest for knowledge and fun. I'm in my second year at university, trying to wrap my head around the wonders of programming. I'm no expert, but I've dabbled in a bit of everything from ML to mobile dev. What drives me is the idea of innovation - think FinTech, quantum computing, and game-changing tech that's going to rock the world. When I'm not staring at code all day, I love hanging out with fellow tech enthusiasts and swapping stories. See you at the datathon!
