As a competitive and ambitious student, my primary goal for this datathon is to compete and give it my all to win. I've had some decent experiences at previous hackathons, but I'm convinced I can do better. I'm looking forward to throwing myself into challenging problems, outsmarting my opponents, and walking away with the top prize. Expect me to be laser-focused on perfecting my code, collaborating strategically with my team, and making every minute count. Bring it on - I'm ready to put my skills to the test and come out on top! Hey there! I'm LÃ­via, a third-year student with a passion for innovation and coding. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me messing around with AR/VR technology or diving into the world of IoT. This datathon is all about competition and pushing myself to be the best. I've had some solid experiences at hackathons before, but this time I'm going for gold. Bring on the challenge - I'm ready to put my skills to the test and make every minute count!
