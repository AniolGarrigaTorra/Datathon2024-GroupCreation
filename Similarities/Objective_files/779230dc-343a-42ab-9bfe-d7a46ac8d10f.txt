Hey! So, for me, this datathon is all about having an amazing time and making new friends who share my passion for data! I've participated in a few hackathons before, but I know that datathons have this super cool vibe where you get to dive into so many exciting topics and events. My goal is to soak up as much as I can, attend as many sessions as possible, and maybe even squeeze in a few fun challenges with my new buds. Can't wait to meet fellow datathon enthusiasts and have some epic times together! Hey there! I'm Aurora Santos, an 18-year-old second-year student with a passion for solving real-world problems through tech. I've dabbled in coding for a while now, and I love the thrill of turning my ideas into reality. When I'm not studying, you can find me digging into web development, exploring new lifehacks, or talking about my favorite social causes. I'm all about embracing innovation and making a positive impact. This datathon is my chance to meet like-minded folks, learn from the best, and have some unforgettable experiences along the way!
