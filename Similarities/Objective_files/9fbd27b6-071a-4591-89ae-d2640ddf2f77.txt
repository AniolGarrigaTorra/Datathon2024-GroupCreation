Hey there! I'm Avery, and I'm stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to have a blast, make some amazing friends, and get involved in as many events as possible. I'm all about soaking up the vibrant atmosphere, learning from others, and sharing my own experiences and skills. I'm not super competitive, so I'm not worried about winning - I just want to absorb all the cool tech goodness, enjoy the fun activities, and maybe even inspire others along the way. Let's get this datathon started and make some unforgettable memories! Hey there! I'm Avery, an 18-year-old student with a passion for tech and learning. I'm in my second year and loving every minute of it! When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming or coming up with new life hacks to make my day more efficient. I'm super excited to be here at the datathon and can't wait to meet all the amazing people. I'm looking forward to diving into all the exciting events and workshops, and maybe even making some unforgettable memories along the way. Let's make this a datathon to remember!
