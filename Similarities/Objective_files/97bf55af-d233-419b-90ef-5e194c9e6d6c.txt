I'm excited to participate in this datathon and dive deeper into the world of data analytics. My main objective is to learn new things and improve my programming skills. I've had a limited exposure to coding in school, but I'm eager to take on new challenges and push myself outside of my comfort zone. I hope to walk away from this event with a solid understanding of data visualization tools, machine learning concepts, and problem-solving techniques. Ultimately, I want to leave with practical skills and the confidence to tackle real-world problems. Hey there! I'm Aur√®lia Fadrique Dupont, a curious and driven 20-year-old student taking on the datathon challenge. As a budding programmer, I've had a taste of coding in school and I'm itching to dive deeper. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art, and data analytics feels like the perfect fusion of logic and creativity. I'm excited to learn new things, improve my skills, and push myself outside of my comfort zone. Let's make this datathon count!
