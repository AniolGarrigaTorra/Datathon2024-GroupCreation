Hey there! I'm Alejandra, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon. My objective is to soak up the fun and make some awesome memories! I don't necessarily care about winning, to be honest. I'd much rather be chatting with fellow participants, exchanging coding tips, and laughing with new friends. I want to take advantage of the cool events and workshops they've got lined up, and just enjoy the ride. I'm all about that #datathonvibes, you know? Hey everyone! I'm Alejandra, and I'm thrilled to be joining the datathon. As a second-year student, I'm eager to learn and network with fellow coders. I'm all about finding creative ways to simplify tasks and improve efficiency - I've even built a few productivity tools in my free time. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming out to music or experimenting with digital art. My goal for this datathon is to have a blast and maybe even pick up some new tips and tricks from fellow participants. Can't wait to meet you all!
