Hey there! I'm Alex, and I'm super excited to be part of this datathon. Honestly, I'm not here to be a competitive shark, and I don't care if I win or not. What I'm looking for is a blast, some amazing new friends, and an experience that'll make me forget about my stressful uni schedule. I want to learn new stuff, try new things, and just have a laugh with fellow participants. Whether it's hacking away on some code, attending a workshop, or busting out some dance moves in the arcade room - I'm all in! Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Alex, a fourth-year student on a mission to make this datathon an unforgettable adventure. I'm all about creativity, code, and design, and I'm stoked to see what this event brings. With a passion for user experience and a knack for coding, I'm looking forward to collaborating with fellow enthusiasts, trying out new things, and maybe even making a few mistakes along the way. Let's make this a datathon to remember!
