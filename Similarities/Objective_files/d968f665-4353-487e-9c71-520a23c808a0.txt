Hey there! I'm Aurélia, and I'm stoked to be joining the datathon! My goal is to dive deep into the world of data and sharpen my skills. I've had some exposure to programming through my degree, but I know there's still so much to learn. I'm looking forward to immersing myself in the process, getting hands-on with new tools and tech, and leveling up my data game. I'm not too focused on winning - I just want to take away concrete learnings and new experiences that'll help me grow as a developer. Bring it on! Hi! I'm Aurélia, a 20-year-old student with a passion for using technology to make a positive impact. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with IoT projects and exploring the potential of AI and machine learning. I'm stoked to be joining this datathon to take my programming skills to the next level and learn from fellow enthusiasts. With a solid foundation in Android development and agile methodology, I'm excited to dive deep into the world of data and create something meaningful. Let's make some magic happen together!
