My objective for this datathon is to challenge myself and improve my skills in programming and data analysis. I'm not necessarily looking to win, but rather to learn as much as I can and take away new knowledge and techniques to apply to my studies and future projects. I'm excited to work with other participants, get feedback on my ideas, and develop a new perspective on the challenges we'll be tackling. I'm looking forward to a collaborative and educational experience that will help me grow as a developer and a problem-solver. Hey! I'm Emily, a curious and adventurous 18-year-old student. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and innovation. With a solid foundation in programming, I'm excited to challenge myself and learn new tricks at the datathon. I'm drawn to problems that have real-world impact, like improving lives through healthcare or transforming businesses through RPA. I thrive in collaborative environments, and I'm looking forward to sharing ideas, getting feedback, and learning from others. My goal is to grow both personally and professionally, and I'm eager to dive into the challenges ahead!
