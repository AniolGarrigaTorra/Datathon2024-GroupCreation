My ultimate objective is to come out on top - I'm here to win, and I'm willing to put in the work to make it happen. With my previous hackathon experience under my belt, I'm eager to refine my skills and showcase my abilities to the highest level. I'll be diving head-first into the competition, analyzing data, and working tirelessly to craft innovative solutions that stand out from the crowd. My goal is clear: to claim that top prize and prove to myself that I have what it takes to take on the best of the best. Hey there! I'm Ava Welles, a 20-year-old data enthusiast on a mission to reign supreme at this datathon. With a background in web and mobile development, I'm ready to take on the challenges ahead. I'm all about using technology to make a difference, whether it's simplifying processes or creating innovative solutions. When I'm not coding, you can find me vibing to some tunes or getting artistic. My ultimate goal is to win and prove to myself that I've got what it takes to compete with the best. Let's get this datathon started and create some magic!
