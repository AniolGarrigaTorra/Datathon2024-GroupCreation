For me, this datathon is about embracing the party vibe, exploring new technologies, and meeting fellow data enthusiasts! I'm not about intense competition, so I won't be stressing about beating anyone. I want to soak up the atmosphere, attend as many workshops and talks as I can, and strike up conversations with the people around me. My aim is to make some awesome connections, share ideas and learn from others, and just have a blast! Sounds like the perfect combo of tech, socializing, and fun to me! Hey! I'm Aur√©lien, a third-year student with a passion for tech and innovation. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me geeking out over robotic automation or developing apps for Android and iOS. This datathon is all about soaking up the energy and vibes - I'm looking forward to discovering new technologies, meeting fellow data enthusiasts, and swapping stories. My goal is to make some amazing connections, learn from others, and have an absolute blast! I'm in it for the experience, not the prize, so let's have some fun and see where the datathon takes us!
