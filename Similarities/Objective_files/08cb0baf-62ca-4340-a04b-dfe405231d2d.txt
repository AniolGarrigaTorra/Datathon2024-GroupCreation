My goal for this datathon is simple: I want to crush it and win! As a total beginner in the coding scene, I'm not naive about the competition, but I'm willing to put in the long hours and hustle to stand out from the crowd. I'm eager to learn new skills, absorb as much as I can, and prove to myself that I'm capable of producing something amazing. Bring it on - I'm ready to push myself to the limit and take home that trophy! Hey there! I'm Maya Lane, a 17-year-old student diving headfirst into the world of programming. I've only just started learning, but I'm excited to see how far I can go. For this datathon, I'm all about challenging myself and pushing my limits. I want to show myself that I can create something amazing, even with limited experience. I'm willing to put in the hard work and dedication required to succeed. Bring it on, and let's see where this journey takes me!
