My objective for this datathon is to have a blast and make new friends along the way! I'm all about soaking up the atmosphere, participating in as many events as I can, and having fun with like-minded people. I'm not as competitive as I could be, so I'm not too fussed about winning. Instead, I'm excited to chat with fellow participants, learn new things, and explore the data and technology on offer. If I happen to stumble upon some innovative ideas or pick up some new skills, that's a lovely bonus - but the real goal is to make memories and connect with others! Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 2nd-year student with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and learning. When I'm not buried in my books, you can find me building digital things, playing video games, or dreaming up innovative solutions to everyday problems. I'm all about fostering connections and making meaningful memories. My ultimate goal for this datathon is to soak up the excitement, learn alongside fellow enthusiasts, and maybe even stumble upon a revolutionary idea or two. Let's make some unforgettable moments together!
