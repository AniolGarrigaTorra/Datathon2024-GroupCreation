Hey! My goal for this datathon is to crush it and bring home the gold! I've participated in a few hackathons before, and I'm pumped to put my skills to the test. I want to focus on perfecting my Python skills, diving deeper into data visualization, and pushing my way to the top of the leaderboards. I'm all about the win, so I'm ready to put in the long hours, stay up late, and make those algorithms mine! Can't wait to see what this datathon has in store for me! Hey there! I'm LÃ©onara Fontcuberta, and I'm excited to be part of this datathon. As a 22-year-old student, I'm passionate about harnessing the power of technology to solve real-world problems. I've got some experience under my belt with programming, and I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new tricks. My goals for this datathon are pretty straightforward - I want to perfect my Python game, level up my data visualization skills, and make it to the top of the leaderboard! When I'm not coding, you can find me fueling up with coffee or binge-watching the latest sci-fi shows. Let's crush it!
