I'm all about having a blast at this datathon! My goal is to make some awesome new friends, learn some new tricks, and participate in as many events as possible. I'm not too worried about winning, but more about soaking up the energy and vibes of the datathon. I'd love to collaborate with fellow participants, try out new tools and skills, and maybe even discover some new passions! At the end of the day, I just want to leave feeling fulfilled, happy, and maybe even a little bit smarter. Sound good to me! Hey there! I'm Alejandra, a curious and outgoing 19-year-old student. I'm all about making the most of every experience, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon! I'm not the most seasoned developer, but I'm eager to learn and experiment with new tools and techniques. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming to music, doodling art, or trying out lifehacks to make life easier. I'm all about collaboration and meeting new people, so let's get this datathon party started!
