I'm in it to win it! My goal is to bring home the gold, literally. I've participated in a few hackathons before, but this one is the ultimate test of my skills. I've been working on my projects and improving my coding skills to make sure I'm at the top of my game. I want to stay focused and concentrate on delivering the best solution I can, while also networking with other participants to learn from their strengths and weaknesses. Let the battle begin! Hey there! I'm El√≠sabet, a 20-year-old student on a mission to crush the datathon! I've got a passion for innovative technologies and a hunger to build something game-changing. I've got some serious project development experience under my belt, and I'm always looking to improve my skills. You can find me experimenting with coding languages like Go and Rust, or diving deep into IoT projects. My goal is to come out on top, and I'm ready to collaborate and learn from the best. Let's get this datathon started!
