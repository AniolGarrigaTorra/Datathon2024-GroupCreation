For this datathon, I'm all about making connections and having a blast! As a seasoned participant with multiple hackathons under my belt, I know I've already got a solid foundation of skills. This time around, I'm focusing on meeting new people, learning from their perspectives, and sharing my own experiences. I want to dive into as many events as possible, absorb new knowledge, and make memories with my fellow datathon-ers. Let's do this! Hi! I'm Léa García, a 22-year-old student with a passion for coding and collaboration. With several hackathons under my belt, I'm no stranger to intense problem-solving sessions and the thrill of bringing innovative ideas to life. Outside of coding, I'm all about connection and community. This datathon is all about expanding my network, learning from others, and building lasting memories. Whether it's exploring the world of web development, machine learning, or something new, I'm excited to dive in and make the most of this event. Can't wait to meet you all and see what magic we can create!
