Hey! I'm super excited to be part of this datathon and I'm focused on leveling up my skills. My main objective is to learn as much as I can from this experience and improve my programming abilities. I'm hoping to gain hands-on experience with new tools and techniques, and maybe even discover some new areas of interest within the world of data science. I'm a total beginner when it comes to datathons, so I'm ready to soak up as much knowledge as I can and return to uni with new skills and fresh ideas! Hey there! I'm Luna Ana Rodriguez, a second-year student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. As a self-taught beginner, I'm eager to dive into the world of data science and level up my skills. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me building web projects or scouring the internet for gaming hacks. I'm excited to trade my textbooks for datasets and explore new areas of interest. I'm all about learning, so bring on the challenges - I'm ready to absorb every bit of knowledge and take my skills to the next level!
