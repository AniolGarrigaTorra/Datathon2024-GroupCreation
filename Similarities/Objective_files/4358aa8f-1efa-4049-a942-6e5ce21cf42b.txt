Hey there! My objective for this datathon is pretty straightforward - I'm here to level up my skills and expand my knowledge. I'm a bit of a beginner in the programming world, so I'm eager to learn new techniques, methodologies, and languages. I'd love to get hands-on experience working on real-world projects and receiving feedback from experienced mentors. My goal is to emerge from this event feeling more confident, motivated, and equipped to take on new challenges back in my daily life. Let's get learning! Hi there! I'm Lola, a 20-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. I'm in my third year of studying programming, and I'm super excited to be here at the datathon! I've had a blast diving into Robotic Process Automation and exploring the intersection of technology and real-world problems. I'm eager to learn from the best and level up my skills, so I can take on new challenges and make a real impact. I'm a bit of a curious cat, always looking to learn and adapt, and I can't wait to see what this weekend has in store!
