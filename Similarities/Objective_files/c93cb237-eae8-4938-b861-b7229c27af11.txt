Hey there! I'm Nuria, and I'm stoked to be part of this datathon! For me, the objective is to level up my skills and learn new tricks. As a 3rd-year CS student with some hackathon experience, I'm looking to dive deeper into machine learning and data analysis. I'd love to pick the brains of other participants, learn from their expertise, and share my own knowledge. My goal is to take home new ideas and insights that'll help me grow as a developer, and maybe even snag a few insights that'll come in handy for my thesis project. Let's do this! Hey, I'm Nuria! I'm a third-year CS student with a passion for building things that make life easier and more fun. I've had some experience with hackathons and competitions, and I'm always looking to level up my skills. For this datathon, I'm excited to dive deeper into machine learning and data analysis, and learn from others in the community. I'm also keen on exploring the intersection of tech and education, and seeing how we can use innovation to make learning more engaging and accessible.
