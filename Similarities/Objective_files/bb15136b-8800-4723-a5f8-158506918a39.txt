I'm in it to win it! As a rookie in the world of programming, I'm super determined to bring home the trophy. I know my skills might not be the most advanced yet, but I'm all about hustling and learning on the fly. I'm ready to put in the long hours, crush the competition, and show everyone what I'm capable of. My objective is clear: take the top spot and become the champion of this datathon. Bring. It. On! Hey there! I'm Sophie Lane, a 19-year-old student with a passion for making a difference. I'm in my first year of programming, but I'm determined to quickly level up and take on the world! I love the idea of using tech to drive positive change and am excited to see how data can help us create a better future. When I'm not coding, you can find me devouring podcasts on social entrepreneurship or binge-watching documentaries on robotics. For me, datathons are the ultimate adrenaline rush, and I'm stoked to be a part of this competition - bring it on!
