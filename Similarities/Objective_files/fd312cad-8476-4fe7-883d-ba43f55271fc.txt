Hi! I'm Alexandra, and for this datathon, my goal is to soak up the fun and camaraderie vibes. I'm all about making new friends and having an awesome time, while still getting to learn a thing or two. I'm excited to participate in as many events as I can, from workshop sessions to hacking challenges, and maybe even join some spontaneous jam sessions or networking meetups. It's not all about the prize - I want to walk away with a big smile on my face and some awesome memories! Hey there! I'm Alexandra Garc√≠a, a fourth-year student passionate about exploring the intersection of tech and everyday life. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me geeking out over blockchain and AI. As a curious problem-solver, I love learning new skills and making the most out of tech. I'm all about friendly vibes and collaboration - I'm excited to meet fellow enthusiasts and work together to tackle new challenges! Let's have some fun and make some magic happen at the datathon!
