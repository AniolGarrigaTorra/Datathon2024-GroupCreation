Hey! As for me, I'm super stoked to be at this datathon! My main objective is to make some new buddies and have an amazing time. I'm all about vibing with like-minded people, learning new skills, and taking part in as many events as possible. I'm not too fussed about winning - I'm all about the experience, the fun, and the friendships. I'd love to meet new people, share some laughs, and create unforgettable memories. If I learn something new along the way, that's a bonus, but for me, it's all about the journey, not the destination. Hey there! I'm Sofia, a 20-year-old student with a thirst for adventure and a passion for learning. I'm excited to be here at the datathon, ready to soak up new skills and experiences. I'm all about collaboration and creativity, always looking for ways to make a positive impact. When I'm not coding, you can find me designing UIs or dreaming up innovations. I'm here to have a blast, meet like-minded people, and take home some amazing memories. Can't wait to vibe with you!
