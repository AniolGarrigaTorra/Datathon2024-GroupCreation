For me, it's all about vibing with new people and having an awesome time at the datathon! I don't expect to win or blow anyone away with my coding skills (although, let's be real, I'll do my best!), I just want to relax, learn some new stuff, and soak up the atmosphere. I'm super excited to try out new tools and frameworks, attend the workshops, and participate in team challenges. My goal is to make friends, have fun, and get out of my comfort zone - it's gonna be a blast, and I'm stoked to be a part of it! Hey, I'm Lucas! A 4th-year student just looking to have an amazing time at the datathon. I'm not super into winning or impressing people with my coding skills (though I'll definitely give it a shot). My goal is to meet awesome people, learn some new tricks, and chill with new folks. I'm really stoked to try out new tools and technologies, attend workshops, and be part of team challenges. I'm all about vibing with new people, making friends, and stepping out of my comfort zone. Can't wait to rock this datathon and make some unforgettable memories!
