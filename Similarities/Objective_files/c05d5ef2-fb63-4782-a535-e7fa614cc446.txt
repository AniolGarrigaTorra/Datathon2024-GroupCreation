My objective for this datathon is to level up my skills and knowledge in data analysis and programming. I'm looking to learn from experienced mentors and fellow participants, and absorb as much as I can from the workshops and presentations. I want to challenge myself to try new things and take risks, and walk away with tangible skills and projects I can be proud of. It's not about winning, but about personal growth and being a better programmer by the end of this weekend. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Luisa Cambridge, a curious and adventurous 20-year-old student looking to take my programming skills to the next level. With a strong passion for making technology accessible and user-friendly, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to innovate and streamline processes. Throughout my journey, I've been obsessed with finding creative solutions that blend design, technology, and social impact. I'm thrilled to be joining this datathon and can't wait to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, learn from the best, and emerge as a better programmer. Let's get this data party started!
