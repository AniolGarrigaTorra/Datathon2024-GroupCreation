I'm all about pushing myself to the limit, learning new things, and coming out on top. Bring it on! Hey there! I'm Sofia Luna, a 19-year-old aspiring coder. I'm pumped to be here at the datathon, where I'm looking to put my skills to the test and show off my stuff. As a first-year student with some beginner-level coding experience under my belt, I'm itching to dive in and learn as much as I can.
