Hi! I'm Luna, and I'm super stoked to be participating in this datathon! My objective is to have a blast and make new friends. I'm all about enjoying the ride and getting the most out of this experience. I want to take part in as many events as possible, from workshops to meetups, and learn as much as I can along the way. I'm all about having fun and being social, so I'm looking forward to meeting fellow data enthusiasts and geeking out together! Hey there! I'm Luna, a 20-year-old student with a passion for all things tech. I'm excited to be here and I'm looking forward to diving into the world of data science. In my free time, I love playing around with new programming languages and tools, and I'm always up for a coding challenge. I'm all about learning from others and having a good time, so I'm hoping to connect with like-minded people and geek out together!
