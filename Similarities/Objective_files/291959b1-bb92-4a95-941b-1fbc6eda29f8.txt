I'm super excited to be here for this datathon! My goal is to soak up the entire experience, no pun intended! I'm looking to make new friends, learn how we all approach different problems, and have an amazing time doing it. I'm all about collaboration and seeing how my fellow participants solve real-world issues. I'd love to participate in as many events as I can, whether it's hackathons, workshops, or even just casually chillin' with others. I know I'll come out of this feeling energized, inspired, and maybe even with some fresh connections! Hey there! I'm Leandra, a third-year student looking to level up my skills at this datathon. I'm a curious problem-solver with a passion for exploring innovative technologies. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me experimenting with augmented reality or trying to streamline my productivity workflow. I'm all about collaboration and learning from others, and I'm excited to see how my fellow participants approach problem-solving. I'm looking forward to an action-packed weekend of fun, networking, and maybe even discovering some fresh inspiration. Can't wait to see what's in store!
