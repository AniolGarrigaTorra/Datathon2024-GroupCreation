I loved working on a non-technical project I started during my freshman year - MoodMingle, a wellness app that aimed to connect people struggling with mental health issues. I didn't have a team, just me, but it was a massive passion project. I spent weekends and late nights designing the user interface, crafting a plan to feature calming animations, and even creating a simple machine learning model using PyTorch to detect and respond to users' emotions. Although it was far from perfect, seeing people share their experiences and connect through the app gave me a sense of fulfillment like no code project ever has. What a thrilling question! I'm super stoked about the prospect of contributing to the development of a decentralized health platform that utilizes blockchain technology to securely store and manage patients' medical records. My dream is to see a platform where individuals have full control over their own health data, enabling seamless sharing and collaboration among medical professionals, insurers, and researchers. Imagine being able to access your electronic medical record from anywhere, anytime, with transparency and trustworthiness built-in! The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to be a part of this groundbreaking journey!
