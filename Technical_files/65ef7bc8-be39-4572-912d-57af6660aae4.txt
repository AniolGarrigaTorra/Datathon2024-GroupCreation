I loved working on a project where I created a mobile app to help people reduce their waste by tracking their daily habits and providing personalized recommendations. I used Java and Python to build the app, and then deployed it to both Android and iOS platforms. I also used data visualization to make the insights more engaging and fun to interact with. Seeing people use the app and actually change their behavior was incredibly rewarding. I learned so much from the experience, from design thinking to API integration, and it was an amazing feeling to know that I was contributing to making a positive impact! I'm thrilled to think about the future, and my ultimate dream is to develop a cutting-edge, AI-powered virtual therapy platform that utilizes machine learning to empower people with mental health concerns. As someone who's passionate about social good, I envision this platform providing accessible, stigma-free support to those in need. With my skills in PyTorch and data visualization, I plan to create an intelligent companion that utilizes conversational AI and personalized data insights to deliver targeted interventions and resource guidance. My goal is to make mental wellness more accessible and reduce the mental health treatment gap worldwide.
