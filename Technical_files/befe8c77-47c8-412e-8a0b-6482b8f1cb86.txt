I've always had a blast working on my own personal IoT project, a smart fridge reminder system! I used Arduino and some clever coding to create a system that would send me notifications when groceries were about to expire. It was amazing to see my idea come to life, and I loved troubleshooting and refining the project to get it just right. It was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment when it all came together. Plus, it's a practical project that I've actually used in my daily life - win-win! I'm super stoked to work on a project that combines my passions for IoT and machine learning to develop an intelligent, voice-activated smart home system for people with disabilities. The goal is to create a seamless, user-friendly experience that can be controlled and interacted with through voice commands or even gestures, ensuring greater independence and autonomy. Imagine being able to adjust your home's temperature, lighting, and entertainment systems with just your voice - it's not just sci-fi! I'd love to explore AI-powered assistants that can learn individual preferences and adapt to their users' needs, making life easier and more enjoyable.
