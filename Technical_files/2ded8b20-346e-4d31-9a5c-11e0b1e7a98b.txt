I've really enjoyed working on a project that combined my love for gaming and programming - a text-based RPG game built in Rust! I learned so much about object-oriented programming, error handling, and debugging. It was my first project that really challenged me, and I loved overcoming the obstacles. I even made some really cool features, like a character stats system and a simple AI for NPCs. My friends were super impressed when I showed it off, and it made me feel proud of my progress. I can't wait to work on more projects that combine my passions! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about utilizing data science to improve healthcare. In the next 10 years, I envision developing AI-powered medical diagnostic tools that leverage patient data and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and personalized treatment plans. I'd love to work on projects that integrate machine learning with medical devices, enabling real-time health monitoring and early disease detection. My dream is to contribute to a world where data science empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, and patients receive optimized care. I'm excited to explore this field and potentially shape the future of healthcare.
