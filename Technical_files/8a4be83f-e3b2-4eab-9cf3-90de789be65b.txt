I've always been fascinated by AR/VR, so I decided to work on a project that combined those interests with my passion for productivity. I built a virtual assistant that uses AR to help you declutter your digital life. It uses TensorFlow and computer vision to identify distracting apps and notifications, then generates a 3D animation to gently guide you to dismiss them. The AI also analyzes your habits to suggest personalized productivity boosts. I learned a lot about computer vision and built a working prototype using Flutter. It was a fun challenge that really got my creative juices flowing! I'm stoked to say that I'm super pumped to dive into the realm of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) development. As someone who's always fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experience, I envision a future where immersive experiences become an integral part of our daily lives. I'd love to work on creating AR-powered interfaces that blend seamlessly with our surroundings, revolutionizing industries like healthcare, education, and entertainment. With AR and VR, the possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to contribute to the innovation and growth of this rapidly evolving field!
