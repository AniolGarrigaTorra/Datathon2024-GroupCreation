I loved working on a personal project where I created a smart planner using IoT and machine learning. I built a prototype that could detect my emotions based on my brain activity (thanks to a brain-computer interface!) and adjust my daily schedule accordingly. It was so cool seeing my to-do list tailored to my mood! The coding part was super fun, and I enjoyed experimenting with Rust for the first time. But the best part was sharing my creation with friends and family, and watching them marvel at the tech. It felt like I was making a real impact on people's lives. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next decade, I'm eager to contribute to developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and social good. I'd love to create a platform that utilizes Natural Language Processing and IoT integration to provide real-time disaster response support. Imagine a system that can automatically detect and alert authorities about emergency situations, ultimately saving lives and reducing damage. The thought of being part of something that could have a tangible impact on people's lives gets me pumped up! The intersection of tech and social impact is what drives me.
