I'm really passionate about AR gaming, and I had a blast working on a project last year where I used Flutter and ARKit to create a mobile app that brought augmented reality monsters to life in real-world environments. It was so cool to see my friends and family's reactions when they saw these digital creatures hovering in front of them! The project was a great way for me to experiment with computer vision and machine learning, and I even integrated a custom AI engine to allow the monsters to react to user input. It was an amazing feeling to see my idea come to life! As I look ahead, I'm thrilled to see where technology will take us. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to dive into the world of Artificial Intelligence-assisted healthcare. I envision AI algorithms diagnosing and treating illnesses, predicting patient outcomes, and revolutionizing medical research. With my skills in NLP and PyTorch, I'd love to contribute to the development of chatbots that offer personalized health advice and emotional support to patients. My goal is to be part of a team that creates a virtual AI nurse that can accurately diagnose rare diseases and streamline healthcare processes. The potential to change lives is immense!
