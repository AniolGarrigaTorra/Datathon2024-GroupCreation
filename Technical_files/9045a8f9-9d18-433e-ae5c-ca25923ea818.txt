I loved working on a personal project where I created a simple augmented reality game using Figma and iOS Development skills. I designed and built a 3D treasure hunt game, where players could use their device's camera to see virtual coins and puzzles in the real world. It was exciting to see my idea come to life and to learn about the possibilities of AR. I enjoyed the process of designing and implementing the game, and I was proud to see it work seamlessly on my iPhone. It was a fun way to test my skills and push myself creatively! What a thrilling question! In the next decade, I'm genuinely enthusiastic about harnessing the immense potential of Machine Learning and AI to revolutionize the education landscape. Specifically, I dream of developing personalized, adaptive learning systems that utilize natural language processing and computer vision to tailor educational content to individual students' needs, abilities, and learning styles. By doing so, I hope to bridge the skills gap, make education more accessible, and democratize knowledge - empowering a new generation of learners to grow, create, and thrive!
