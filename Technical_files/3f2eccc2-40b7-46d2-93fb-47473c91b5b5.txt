I loved working on a personal project where I used computer vision and PyTorch to build a virtual fitness buddy that uses facial recognition to track my workouts. I set up a mini gym in my living room and attached a camera to the ceiling to capture my exercises. The AI then tracked my movements, providing real-time feedback on form and suggesting adjustments. It was amazing to see the progress and even started incorporating gamification elements, like rewarding myself with points and badges. It was a fantastic way to stay motivated and learn more about AI - and now I have a virtual friend to stay accountable! I'm thrilled to say that in the next 10 years, I'm hoping to make a significant impact in the field of healthcare technology. I'm passionate about using data and AI to develop innovative solutions that can transform the way people receive care and manage their health. Specifically, I'd love to work on projects that leverage computer vision and machine learning to help diagnose rare diseases more accurately and efficiently. The idea of being part of a medical breakthrough that improves people's lives is truly what gets me excited - it's an opportunity to combine my technical skills with my empathy for humanity.
