I loved working on a personal project where I used machine learning to develop a chatbot that could help people find and schedule yoga classes in my city. I built the bot using TensorFlow and combined it with a web interface using React. It was amazing to see how I could use my skills to create something that made a real difference in people's lives. Plus, I got to learn a ton about backend development, scalability, and optimization. It was a solo project, but the feeling of accomplishment when I finally deployed it was incredible! I'm thrilled to share that I'm eager to make a significant impact on global healthcare through AI and Machine Learning. In the next 10 years, I envision leveraging my expertise to develop innovative, AI-powered systems that improve disease diagnosis accuracy, streamline patient treatment processes, and increase access to quality healthcare for underserved populations. Specifically, I'd love to work on projects that empower personal wellness monitoring, predict patient outcomes, and automate administrative tasks, freeing up medical professionals to focus on high-touch care. The prospect of making a tangible difference in people's lives keeps me up at night - in a good way!
