I've got a soft spot for a pet project I worked on last semester - a conversational AI chatbot built using TensorFlow and Flask! I was blown away by how I could create a bot that could understand and respond to natural language inputs. It was amazing to see my code come to life, chatting with friends and even having a bit of a sense of humor. Although it's still in its infancy, it's been a blast refining its algorithms and testing its limits. I'm thrilled to share that I'm absolutely fascinated by the concept of developing AI-powered decision-making systems for social impact. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on creating scalable, bias-free solutions that enable underserved communities to access vital services, such as financial inclusion, healthcare, and education. With my passion for Fintech and Machine Learning, I envision contributing to the development of algorithms that seamlessly integrate with Quantum Computing, ensuring seamless processing of massive datasets and enabling real-time, data-driven decision-making. I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share this vision and drive positive change.
