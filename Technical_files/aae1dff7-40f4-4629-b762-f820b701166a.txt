I loved working on a Flutter mobile app I built as part of a hackathon. The challenge was to create a music discovery platform that utilized machine learning to suggest songs based on user preferences. I used PyTorch to train the model, and then integrated it with my Flutter app. Seeing users interact with the app and discover new music was incredibly fulfilling. I enjoyed the fusion of art and technology, and the thrill of solving problems as they arose. It was a project that pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow as a developer and a musician. What an exciting question! In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to see the evolution of Blockchain and its widespread adoption across various industries. As someone fascinated by the intersection of technology and art, I envision creating an innovative platform that utilizes blockchain to ensure provenance and authenticity for the art market. This platform would utilize Machine Learning to track and verify ownership, transactions, and appraisal records, revolutionizing the way we interact with and appreciate art. It's a dream that combines my passion for tech, art, and design, and I believe the potential impact could be enormous!
