I really enjoyed working on a project where I built a simple chatbot using Python to help my school's counseling department. They had a lot of student resources on their website, but it was hard for students to find what they needed. So, I built a bot that would answer students' questions about resources like clubs, study spaces, and counseling services. It was a blast working on it, and the counselors were super stoked to have it. It was a great project for me to learn about natural language processing and conditional statements. Plus, it's making a tangible difference at my school! You know, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and social good. In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to be a part of a project that utilizes machine learning and AI to amplify marginalized voices and help address issues like education inequality and access to healthcare. I envision a world where data-driven solutions help identify and bridge gaps in communities that are often overlooked. I'd love to be working on a platform that leverages natural language processing and deep learning to empower underserved populations, giving them a stronger voice in the world. That's my 10-year goal - making a difference through technology and community engagement!
