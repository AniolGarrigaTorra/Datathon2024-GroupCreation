I really enjoyed working on a project where I designed a mobile app for a small e-commerce store. It was a non-technical project, but it challenged me to think about the user experience and how to effectively communicate with a team. I was responsible for UI/UX design and wireframing the app, which was a great way to put my design skills to the test. Seeing the project come together and getting feedback from the store owners was super fulfilling. It was also my first time working on a project that wasn't programming-related, so it was a nice change of pace and allowed me to develop my creative side! As I gaze into the future, I'm thrilled to envision a world where AI and tech have become an integral part of everyday life. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing innovative healthcare solutions that utilize natural language processing and data visualization to analyze patient data and tailor treatment plans. I see a future where AI-assisted medical diagnoses and precision medicine become the norm, saving countless lives and improving patient outcomes. This datathon has piqued my interest in Fintech and Health, and I hope to leverage my skills in Python and MongoDB to contribute to this noble pursuit.
