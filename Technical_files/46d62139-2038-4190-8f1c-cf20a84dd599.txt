I recently worked on a personal project that combines two of my favorite tech interests: Computer Vision and Lifehacks! I built an AI-powered smart plant watering system using Python and PyTorch. I designed a simple camera-based sensor to detect when my plants need watering, and the system would then send me notifications to ensure they stay hydrated. It was an incredible experience, integrating AI, vision, and sensor capabilities to solve a real-life problem. Plus, it's a great feeling knowing my plants are thriving while I'm not worrying about overwatering or underwatering them! I'm thrilled to share that I've always been passionate about revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. In the next decade, I envision creating a conversational AI system that enables seamless voice command management for individuals with disabilities. This AI would learn an individual's daily routines and needs, allowing them to effortlessly control various aspects of their daily life, such as smart home devices, calendar appointments, and even medication reminders. My goal is to empower independence and alleviate the burden of daily tasks, allowing individuals to focus on what matters most - living life to the fullest.
