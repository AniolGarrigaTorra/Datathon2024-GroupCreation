I had a blast working on a project where I built a chatbot for a virtual reality experience! I used PyTorch to create a simple machine learning model that could respond to user input and adapt to their preferences. It was amazing to see how engaging users were with the bot and how it could enhance their overall VR experience. I also got to explore Figma for the first time, designing the chatbot's UI/UX, which was a lot of fun. This project allowed me to combine my interests in AI, AR, and gaming, and I'm super proud of how it turned out! I'm beyond thrilled to share my excitement about a project that combines my passions for gaming, education, and technology. I'd love to develop an immersive, AI-powered augmented reality platform that provides inclusive learning experiences for underprivileged children worldwide. The platform would utilize blockchain-based tracking systems to monitor students' progress and offer personalized learning recommendations. With Figma's UI expertise and PyTorch's AI chops, I envision a future where accessibility meets entertainment, allowing students from all corners of the globe to engage with engaging, interactive lessons that inspire and empower them to reach their full potential.
