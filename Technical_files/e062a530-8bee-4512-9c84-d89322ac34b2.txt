I've always loved working on a project where I could combine my passion for retail and design! For a school project, I created a minimalist e-commerce platform using React and PostgreSQL, focusing on a sustainable fashion brand. I designed the UI/UX in Figma, and built a backend to manage products and orders. The best part was seeing how my design skills and coding skills came together to create a user-friendly experience. Even though it was a challenge, it was so satisfying to receive feedback from classmates and professors, and hearing that the app could be something that real people would use. As I reflect on my goals for the next decade, I'm thrilled to think about contributing to the development of revolutionary technologies that have the potential to transform the world. In particular, I'm eager to focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and retail. I envision creating an AI-powered e-commerce platform that leverages blockchain to ensure data transparency, integrity, and security. This platform would enable customers to shop sustainably while fostering responsible data sharing practices among retailers. With cutting-edge tech and data analysis skills under my belt, I'm confident that I can help bring this vision to life.
