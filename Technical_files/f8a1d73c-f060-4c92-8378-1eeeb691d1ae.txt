One project that stands out to me was when I created a voice-based conversational bot using Flutter and the Google Cloud Natural Language API. It was a fun experiment to combine my interests in education and voice skills. I designed the bot to assist with homework help for middle school students, allowing them to ask questions and receive step-by-step solutions. Seeing it come to life and getting feedback from my peers and friends was incredibly rewarding. It was a great way to challenge myself and explore the possibilities of voice-based interfaces. As I gaze into the tech horizon, I envision a future where AI-driven voice assistants revolutionize education. Imagine personalized learning platforms that adapt to an individual's learning style, speed, and needs, providing customized resources and mentorship. I'm thrilled at the prospect of developing a voice-driven AI platform that utilizes machine learning to understand a student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning objectives. This platform would empower educators to focus on what matters most - fostering a love for learning - while the AI seamlessly handles the nitty-gritty of instruction, assessment, and feedback. That's the future I hope to contribute to!
