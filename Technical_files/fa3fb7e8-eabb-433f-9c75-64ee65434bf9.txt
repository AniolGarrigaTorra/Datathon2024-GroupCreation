I recently worked on a school project building an AR chatbot using Natural Language Processing and Flutter. It was a blast! I created a digital representation of a coffee shop where users could walk in, interact with the environment, and have a conversation with the bot using voice commands. It was amazing to see my code come to life and people's reactions when they experienced it. What I enjoyed most was experimenting with different AR effects and NLP techniques to make the chatbot sound and look more natural. It was a fantastic way to combine my interests in tech and creativity! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about developing immersive, interactive, and secure AR/VR experiences that transform the way we communicate and interact with information. In the next decade, I envision myself pioneering innovative solutions that bridge the gap between humans and technology, creating new forms of artistic expression, therapeutic platforms, and revolutionary educational tools. As I continue to refine my skills in programming, cybersecurity, and NLP, I'm excited to be part of this technological revolution, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and making a lasting impact on society. It's going to be an incredible ride!
