I loved working on a project that used computer vision to help visually impaired individuals navigate through crowded public places. We developed an app that used a smartphone's camera to identify obstacles and provide audio cues to the user, allowing them to independently navigate through busy areas. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, combining my passions for social good, Fintech, and innovation. Seeing the impact it could have on people's daily lives really made it stand out. I was the primary UI/UX designer, which was a new challenge for me, but it pushed me to learn and grow as a developer. What gets me truly stoked is the possibility of creating a game-changing, impact-driven project that bridges the gap between Fintech and Social Good. I'm talking about developing an AI-powered lending platform for socially responsible, sustainable businesses, empowering them to thrive and create positive environmental and social change. I'd love to work with like-minded individuals to conceptualize, design, and launch a platform that not only generates revenue but also fosters a culture of conscious consumption and innovation. The thrill of pushing boundaries and making a tangible difference in the world gets my creative juices flowing!
