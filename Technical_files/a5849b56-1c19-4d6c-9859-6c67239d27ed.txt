I had an absolute blast working on a personal project to develop an accessible puzzle game for visually impaired children using AR and ML. I used Unity, Python, and TensorFlow to create a game that relied on audio and haptic feedback to guide players. The goal was to encourage learning through fun interactions. I loved the freedom to experiment and learn new skills while creating something that could make a real difference in people's lives. Seeing the first test players' smiles when they decoded their first puzzle was incredibly rewarding - it was a truly non-competitive, creative outlet for me! I'm thrilled to be working on a project that combines my passions for AR/VR, education, and social good. I envision developing an immersive, virtual reality platform that allows students to explore complex concepts, such as climate change, financial literacy, and social justice, in a interactive and engaging way. The platform would enable teachers to create customized lessons, track student progress, and receive real-time feedback. Imagine students traveling virtually to different parts of the world, witnessing historical events firsthand, or experiencing the consequences of sustainability - it's an incredible opportunity to shape the next generation of thinkers and leaders.
