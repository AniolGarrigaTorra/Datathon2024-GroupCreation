I recently worked on a project to create a wearable device that tracks vitals and provides feedback for improving mental wellness. I developed the user interface and experience using Flutter and UI/UX design principles. I also integrated sensor data collection and processing using Python and machine learning algorithms. It was an amazing experience to see how tech could have a direct impact on people's lives. I loved combining my interests in health, design, and programming to create something innovative. The wearable device was a prototype, but I'm proud of how far I was able to take it in just a few months! What an exciting thought! In the next 10 years, I'd love to contribute to the development of personal health monitoring wearables using blockchain technology. Imagine devices that track your vital signs, activity levels, and other health metrics, storing this data securely and privately using blockchain's decentralized architecture. This tech could revolutionize the healthcare industry, enabling individuals to take a more proactive approach to their well-being and potentially predicting and preventing chronic diseases. It's a daunting task, but one that aligns with my passions for health, technology, and cybersecurity.
