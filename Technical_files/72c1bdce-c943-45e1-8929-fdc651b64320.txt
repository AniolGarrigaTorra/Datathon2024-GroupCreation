I loved working on a project where I created a simple language learning app using Flutter and NLP. It was an open-source project, and my friend was the lead developer. I contributed to the feature development and design of the app. I found it exciting to integrate NLP algorithms to correct the user's pronunciation and provide personalized feedback. The best part was seeing the app come to life, and being able to test it with friends and family. It was a great way to apply my technical skills to something practical and meaningful, and I loved seeing the impact it had on language learners. I'm thrilled to share my passion project with you! In the next 10 years, I aim to revolutionize healthcare by leveraging AI and AR/VR to develop a virtual reality platform that empowers individuals to better understand and manage their physical and mental well-being. Imagine stepping into a virtual environment that provides personalized coaching, therapy, and educational resources, all guided by AI-driven insights. My goal is to make this innovative platform accessible to underprivileged communities, bridging the gap in healthcare equality. It's ambitious, but I believe my unique blend of skills in design, education, and tech can make it a reality.
