One project that I've thoroughly enjoyed working on is a robot I built using the RoboFit platform and Raspberry Pi. I got to combine my interests in AI, robotic process automation, and learning new programming languages to bring my robot to life. I programmed it to do cool things like follow me around the room, recognize my voice, and even do a little dance. Seeing my creation move and respond to my voice was super fulfilling, and it was awesome to apply my skills in a hands-on way. I had a blast bringing it to life and sharing it with my friends and family! The future is bright! In the next decade, I'm thrilled to work on developing more intuitive and inclusive Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions that empower people of all ages and abilities. I envision AI-powered virtual companions that assist the elderly and people with disabilities, making everyday life simpler and more enjoyable. Imagine a world where AI systems can seamlessly translate languages, allowing global connectivity and collaboration to thrive. My dream is to see AI not only augment human capabilities but also foster deeper empathy and understanding between individuals. It's an ambitious goal, but the possibilities are endless, and I'm stoked to be part of the journey!
