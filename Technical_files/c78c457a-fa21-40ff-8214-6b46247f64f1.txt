One project that really stands out to me is my natural language processing (NLP) chatbot for a mental health organization. I chose React Native to develop the chatbot, and it was so much fun seeing it come to life! I integrated a vast library of mental health-related phrases and responses, allowing users to have anonymous and confidential conversations with the bot. It was amazing to see the impact it had on people's lives, and it really solidified my passion for NLP and chatbot development. Working on this project was not only challenging but also fulfilling, and I'd love to take it to the next level at the datathon! I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next decade, I'd love to be at the forefront of developing an AR-based e-commerce platform that utilizes machine learning to predict user preferences and create immersive shopping experiences. I envision shoppers being able to virtually try on outfits, interact with product demos, and receive personalized recommendations through innovative interfaces. The goal is to revolutionize the way people shop and make retail more sustainable and enjoyable. With my skills in natural language processing, Android development, and blockchain, I believe I have a solid foundation to tackle this ambitious project.
