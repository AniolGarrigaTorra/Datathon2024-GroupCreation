One project I really enjoyed working on was creating a mobile app to track personal progress for my university's language exchange program. I worked with Android Studio and JavaScript to design a user-friendly interface and connect it to a Firebase database. Seeing my app come to life and knowing it was making a difference for students and exchange participants was super fulfilling! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on creating a revolutionary AI-powered educational platform that utilizes Blockchain technology to store and verify student records, skill certificates, and even personal achievements. This platform would allow for seamless tracking and recognition of students' progress, allowing them to have a digital footprint that's secure, transparent, and accessible. I envision a future where education is democratized, and individuals can showcase their skills and expertise to the world, breaking boundaries and creating a more interconnected, knowledge-driven society.
