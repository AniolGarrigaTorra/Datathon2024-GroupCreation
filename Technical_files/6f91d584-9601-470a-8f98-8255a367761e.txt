I loved working on a mobile app project where I built a personal finance tracking app using Swift and PostgreSQL. I was tasked with creating a seamless user experience to help users stay on top of their expenses. I used Agile methodology to breakdown the project into manageable tasks and iteratively developed the app. It was my first time building a native iOS app, and I was thrilled to see it come to life! Seeing users download and review my app was the icing on the cake. It showed me that my skills could make a real difference in people's lives. I'm thrilled to think about the future of artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. As someone who's passionate about health and wellness, I believe AI can play a crucial role in personalizing medical treatment, streamlining diagnosis, and improving patient outcomes. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on developing an AI-powered platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze medical literature, predict patient responses to treatments, and even enable voice-controlled health monitoring. The thought of being part of a breakthrough like this gets me pumped up!
