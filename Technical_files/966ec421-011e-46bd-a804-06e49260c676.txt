One project that comes to mind is a solo Figma design project where I created a music festival brochure. I loved how I could let my creative juices flow while still applying design principles and best practices. I enjoyed experimenting with fonts, colors, and layouts to create a visually appealing design. The result was a modern and sleek brochure that I'm proud of. It was amazing to see my idea come to life and I felt accomplished when I shared it with my friends. I'd love to dive back into more design projects like this! As a student with a passion for technology and innovation, I'm thrilled to think about the projects I'd love to work on in the next decade. One area that has me particularly stoked is developing more intuitive and immersive AR experiences. I envision a future where people can effortlessly layer digital information onto their surroundings, seamlessly blending the physical and virtual worlds. With the rapid advancements in AI and computer vision, I believe it's within our grasp to create experiences that enhance our daily lives, education, and entertainment. Imagine being able to visualize 3D models in the real world or exploring historical sites in an entirely new way - the possibilities are endless!
