I recently worked on a project to develop a simple appointment scheduling system for my campus's health center using Figma and Python. I really enjoyed designing the UI and UX of the system, as it allowed me to explore my creativity and bring together technical and non-technical skills. The project also gave me a chance to practice my programming skills, especially in Python. Overall, it was a fun and rewarding experience that helped me learn new skills and collaborate with my peers. I'm thrilled to think about my future ambitions! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on creating an augmented reality platform that helps people manage their physical and mental health more effectively. This platform would allow users to track their habits, receive personalized recommendations, and interact with virtual health assistants in an immersive and engaging way. I envision it as a game-changer for the healthcare industry, making it more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. With my skills in Python and Figma, I believe I can bring this vision to life and make a real difference in people's lives.
