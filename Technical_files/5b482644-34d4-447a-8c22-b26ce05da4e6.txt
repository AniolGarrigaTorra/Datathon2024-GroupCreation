I loved working on a personal project to develop a smart mirror using Android Things and Java. I embedded a raspberry pi into an old mirror and created an AR interface that allows me to receive important notifications, set reminders, and even play soothing music. It was a great exercise in IoT and Android development, and I was thrilled to see my idea come to life. It's now a part of my daily routine, and I enjoy customizing it and improving its features. It's projects like these that fuel my passion for technology and motivate me to keep exploring new opportunities. What a fascinating question! As I look forward to the next decade, I'm thoroughly thrilled to see the advancements in AR/VR technology, which I believe will revolutionize the way we interact with the world. I'm talking about virtual cities that allow us to design and optimize urban planning like never before, or immersive healthcare experiences that make medical procedures less daunting. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to contribute to the development of these innovative solutions. As a programmer, the challenge of creating these new interfaces and experiences excites me and keeps me up at night - in the best possible way!
