I had a blast working on a music recommendation system using computer vision and machine learning. I used PyTorch to train a model to analyze lyrics and chord progressions, and then built a UI using Figma and a Docker container. Users could input their favorite artists and songs, and the system would generate a personalized playlist. I loved combining my technical skills with my passion for music and seeing how it brought people together. It was an incredible feeling to share my project with friends and family, and get their feedback and suggestions. It sparked a ton of creative conversations! As I look ahead to the next decade, I'm ecstatic about the prospect of contributing to the development of sustainable cities. I envision using my expertise in IoT, computer vision, and blockchain to design intelligent urban infrastructure that fosters eco-friendly transportation, resource-efficient buildings, and a better quality of life for citizens. I'd love to see the impact of my work extend beyond metropolitan areas to underserved communities worldwide, improving the environment and public health. It's a lofty goal, but with the pace of technological advancements and the collective efforts of innovators, I'm confident we can create a more sustainable tomorrow.
