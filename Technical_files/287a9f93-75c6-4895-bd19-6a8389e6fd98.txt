I loved working on a non-technical project last semester - a blog about sustainable living! As an advocate for social good, I was passionate about sharing my findings on eco-friendly products and habits. I built a simple website using HTML/CSS and added some personal touches like illustrations and images. It was incredible to see my blog grow and receive feedback from like-minded individuals. The project allowed me to connect with others who share similar interests and sparked a passion for me to continue creating content that inspires positive change. It was a rewarding experience to see my ideas come to life! What a thrilling question! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to developing sustainable e-commerce platforms that prioritize social good. As an intersection of my interests in Productivity, Social Good, and E-commerce/Retail, I envision creating a system that helps small, local businesses in underprivileged communities access global markets while promoting fair trade practices. With Machine Learning/AI and Blockchain technologies, I hope to build a platform that automates logistics, provides transparency on supply chains, and empowers these businesses to thrive. It's a lofty goal, but I'm excited to dive in and make a positive impact!
