One project that really stands out to me is a voice-based chatbot I built for a social impact startup. The goal was to help visually impaired individuals access information and services more easily. I used Natural Language Processing to develop a conversational interface that allowed users to ask questions and receive information in a more interactive way. I enjoyed working on this project because it combined my technical skills with my passion for social good. It was a challenging project, but seeing the impact it could have on people's lives made it all worth it. I'm thrilled to see Artificial General Intelligence becoming a reality! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of AI-powered solutions that have a significant positive impact on society. Specifically, I envision AI-assisted healthcare diagnosis and treatment, personalized education tailored to individual learning styles, and accessible and affordable financial services for underprivileged communities. My PhD in AI research will lay the foundation for me to tackle these challenges, and I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals at the datathon to bring this vision closer to reality.
