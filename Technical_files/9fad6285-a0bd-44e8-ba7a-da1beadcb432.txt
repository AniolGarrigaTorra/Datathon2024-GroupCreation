I loved working on a project that merged my passion for music and programming - creating a song recommendation system using natural language processing! I built a React Native app that analyzed lyrics and genres to suggest songs to users. The Figma mockup really came alive as users swiped through tracks and received personalized playlists. Seeing people jamming out to curated music was an incredible feeling! The project pushed me to explore NLP concepts and experiment with API integrations, making me feel proud of my ability to combine technical skills with creative endeavors. As a health enthusiast, I'm thrilled about the prospect of developing AI-powered healthcare solutions. In the next 10 years, I envision creating a voice-assisted medical companion that uses natural language processing and machine learning to empower patients with personalized health advice and medication reminders. This companion would also integrate with wearables and IoT devices to track vital signs and detect potential health risks early on. By bringing together data analysis, voice skills, and IoT, I aim to revolutionize healthcare accessibility and outcome, making a significant impact on people's lives. It's a daunting yet exhilarating challenge!
