I loved working on a project where I combined my interests in AR/VR and cybersecuirty! I created a 3D virtual try-on platform for online shopping, which uses AR to let customers try on virtual clothes and accessories. The twist was that it also integrates cybersecurity features, such as encryption and access controls, to protect customer data. It was a challenge, but seeing my virtual try-on platform come to life was amazing. I even collaborated with friends in other departments, like UX and graphic design, which added a fun team project dynamic. As I look to the future, I'm thrilled about the potential to merge my interests in AR/VR, Cybersecurity, and Education to revolutionize the way we learn. Imagine being able to don a sleek VR headset and explore the digital equivalent of a traditional classroom, where interactive simulations and AI-powered tutorials enhance the learning experience. With secure, real-time access to a library of virtual knowledge hubs, students could gain invaluable skills and confidence without the constraints of physical limitations. It's a tantalizing prospect, and I'm eager to explore the technology, innovation, and collaboration required to make it a reality.
