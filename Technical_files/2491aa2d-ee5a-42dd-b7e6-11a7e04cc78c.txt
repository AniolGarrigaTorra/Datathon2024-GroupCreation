I loved working on a project where I built a simple event scheduling platform using JavaScript and PostgreSQL. I was tasked with creating a web application that allowed users to create and manage events, assign team members, and send reminders. It was a great opportunity to learn more about back-end development and database management. What I enjoyed most was seeing my idea come to life and being able to use it to manage events for my student club. It was a great feeling of accomplishment and a good lesson in problem-solving and debugging. As I sit here, I'm excited to envision myself working on something that combines my passion for music, art, and data analysis. I'd love to create an AI-powered tool that analyzes an artist's musical and artistic style, predicting their future projects and even collaborating with them on new ideas. Imagine being able to generate novel melodies or harmonies using machine learning, or even assisting an artist in generating entire art pieces! With Rust, JavaScript, and data analysis skills under my belt, I believe I have a solid foundation to tackle such a project and see where it takes me.
