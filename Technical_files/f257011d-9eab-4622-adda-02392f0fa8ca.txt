I had a blast working on a pet project called EcoLife. I used React to build a simple web app that helped me track my daily habits and routines related to sustainability. It was my first time using a UI framework, and I loved designing and customizing the layout. I used a SQL database to store user data and AWS for backend storage. It was amazing to see my ideas come to life and understand how tech can impact my daily life. Now, I use EcoLife to stay motivated to reduce my waste, recycle, and even monitor my water usage! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, specifically in the realm of Healthcare Technology. I envision creating a platform that utilizes AI-powered predictive models to identify early warning signs of chronic diseases, empowering individuals to take proactive control of their health. This project would bring together my passion for programming, lifehacks, and gaming to create a tool that can positively impact people's lives. Who knows, maybe it'll even become a revolutionary new standard in healthcare!
