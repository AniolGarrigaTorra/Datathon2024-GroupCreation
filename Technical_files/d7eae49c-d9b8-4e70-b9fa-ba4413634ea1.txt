Man, I'm so passionate about my AR/VR project I worked on over the summer! I created a Virtual Wardrobe app using TypeScript and Figma, allowing users to virtually try on clothes without having to buy or wear them. I designed the UI, built the AR functionality, and even threw in some machine learning for suggesting outfit ideas based on personal style. It was an incredible challenge, and I loved the feeling of bringing something tangible to life. Seeing friends and family try it on and have a blast made all the coding stress worth it! I'm genuinely thrilled about the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry through immersive technologies like AR/VR! Imagine being able to virtually simulate complex medical procedures, creating a more personalized and efficient learning experience for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, AR/VR could be used to empower patients by providing them with interactive treatment plans and allowing them to visualize their progress in real-time. As someone who's just starting to dip my toes into the world of programming, I'm excited to learn more about these technologies and potentially contribute to the development of innovations that can improve lives.
