I had a blast working on a DIY home automation project where I used Arduino and NodeMCU to control my lights, fans, and temperature sensors remotely using my phone. It was a fun project that merged my interests in IoT and music - I even hacked together a simple audio amplifier using a Raspberry Pi to play music from Spotify. It was my first solo project, and I enjoyed the process of troubleshooting and problem-solving. I learned a lot about circuits, programming, and debugging, and it gave me confidence in my abilities to tackle more complex projects. I'm excited to work on building a more intelligent and personalized educational platform that leverages AI and AR/VR technologies to revolutionize the way we learn. Imagine being able to explore a virtual reality lesson that adapts to your learning pace, style, and interests, providing a unique and immersive experience. By integrating machine learning algorithms and IoT sensors, I envision a platform that not only tracks student progress but also adjusts its content in real-time to optimize learning outcomes. It's a dream big enough to change the way we approach education, and I'd love to make it a reality.
