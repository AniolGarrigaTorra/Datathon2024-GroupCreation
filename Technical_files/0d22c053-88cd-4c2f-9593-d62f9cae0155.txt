I recently completed a project that really stood out to me - it was a mobile application I built using Flutter for my university's hackathon. I designed a personalized to-do list app that leveraged computer vision to recognize and categorize tasks based on handwriting recognition. I was thrilled to experiment with both front-end and back-end development skills. The excitement came from seeing my idea come to life and getting feedback from my peers who found it helpful. Working on this project made me realize the impact technology can have on everyday lives and solidified my passion for innovative app development! As a data enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the potential of decentralized technologies, like blockchain. I'm excited to explore how blockchain can be applied to create more transparent, secure, and decentralized systems for data storage and sharing. In the next 10 years, I dream of building a project that enables individuals and organizations to securely share and manage their data, while ensuring their privacy and ownership are protected. With advancements in computer vision and machine learning, I envision a future where data is collected, stored, and used in a way that is trustworthy, transparent, and benefits society as a whole.
