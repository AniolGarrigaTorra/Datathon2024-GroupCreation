I had a blast working on a personal project where I built a virtual therapy dog using AR/VR technology! I'm a huge animal lover, and I wanted to create something that would bring comfort and joy to people's lives. I used PyTorch to train a deep learning model to recognize and respond to emotions, and combined it with Flutter to build a user-friendly app. It was amazing to see people's reactions when they interacted with the therapy dog - it was like a ray of sunshine in their day! I learned so much from the experience, and it's been a super fulfilling project for me. As a health enthusiast, I'm extremely excited about the prospect of combining my passion for AR/VR with health technology. In the next 10 years, I envision working on projects that integrate virtual and augmented reality to revolutionize healthcare. I'd love to develop a platform that utilizes AI-powered 3D modeling to help doctors and patients visualize and understand complex medical conditions, streamline diagnosis and treatment plans, and even enable remote consultations. The potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalization times, and redefine the future of healthcare is a prospect that truly excites me.
