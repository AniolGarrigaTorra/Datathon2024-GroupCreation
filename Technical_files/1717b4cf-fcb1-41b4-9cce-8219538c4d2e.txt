I loved working on a personal project to create a simple mobile app for tracking my cryptocurrency portfolio using iOS Development. It was my first time diving into machine learning, and I used TensorFlow to integrate price prediction functionality. I enjoyed the challenge of designing the user interface with Figma and building the database using MongoDB. The result was a functional app that allowed me to visualize my investments and get alerts when prices hit certain thresholds. It was a great way to combine my interests in programming, cryptocurrency, and personal finance, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment and pride in my coding skills. The future is calling, and I'm thrilled to answer! In the next decade, I'm envisioning a reality where blockchain technology has transformed the way we manage identity verification and personal data. Imagine a world where your digital fingerprint, backed by decentralized and transparent records, becomes the cornerstone of secure online transactions and authentication. As a pioneer in this realm, I'm eager to contribute to shaping the development of decentralized identity platforms, safeguarding individual rights and fostering a more trustworthy digital landscape. It's a bold ambition, but I'm convinced that the potential to reshape the future is within our reach.
