I loved working on a personal project that combined my interests in lifehacks and tech - a smartphone app that helps people with chronic illnesses track and visualize their medication schedules! I used Android development to build the app and incorporated computer vision to identify prescription bottle labels for seamless tracking. Seeing users' positive feedback and feeling the sense of purpose in making a difference motivated me to keep pushing forward. It was an incredible experience that allowed me to bridge the gap between tech and wellness, and I'm excited to explore more opportunities like this in the future! I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'd love to be working on developing AI-powered smart cities that revolutionize the way we live. With my background in computer vision, I envision cities with autonomous vehicles that detect and respond to pedestrian traffic, roads that adapt to traffic conditions in real-time, and green spaces that self-monitor for waste management and sustainability. Imagine a city that's always learning and evolving to become more efficient, environmentally friendly, and people-centric! It's a tall order, but the thought of contributing to such a transformation gets me pumped!
