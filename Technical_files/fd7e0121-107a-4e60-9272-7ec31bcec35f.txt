One project that still gets me pumped is my personal AR experience, Echo. I created an AR app using React Native and Unity, where users can record and relive their most memorable moments through a visually stunning, 3D environment. It was a thrill to combine my passions for music, art, and tech to create something unique and emotive. I loved experimenting with animation and interactivity to bring the experience to life. Echo was a labor of love, and it's amazing to see people connect with it on an emotional level. It's a project that still makes me excited to work on! I'm thrilled to share that I'm fascinated by the prospect of creating a groundbreaking Augmented Reality experience that seamlessly integrates Quantum computing and Blockchain technology. Imagine walking into a concert, where the musician's art gallery comes to life with interactive quantum-inspired visualizations, connected to a secure and decentralized digital collectible marketplace. I envision leveraging my skills in Data Analysis, Rust programming, and Mobile Development to create an immersive experience that disrupts the art and music industries. Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll see a fusion of art, music, and tech that transforms the very fabric of our cultural landscape.
