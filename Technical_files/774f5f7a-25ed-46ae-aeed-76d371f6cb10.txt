I loved working on a React Native app to help visually impaired people navigate their daily lives more efficiently. As a huge music enthusiast, I was fascinated by the concept of soundscaping - generating personalized audio cues to alert users of approaching objects or street corners. It was a great opportunity to apply my UI/UX design skills and programming knowledge to create an accessible tool. Seeing my friends and family who are visually impaired use the app and receiving positive feedback was incredibly rewarding. It's projects like these that inspire me to pursue a career in assistive tech. I'm thrilled to share that I'm eager to tackle the integration of AI and healthcare in the next decade. As someone who's fascinated by the human body and fascinated by technology, I envision a future where AI-powered medical diagnosis and personalized treatment plans revolutionize the healthcare industry. I'd love to work on developing intelligent systems that can detect and predict illnesses, streamlining medical testing, and providing patients with proactive health recommendations. Imagine a world where AI-driven insights enable physicians to deliver more accurate, compassionate care, improving lives and saving countless individuals. That's my dream for the next 10 years!
