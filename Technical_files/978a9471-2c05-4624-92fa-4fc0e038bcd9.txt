I had a blast working on a React Native app for my music club's social media platform! It was a hobby project that combined my passions for music and art with my coding skills. I designed the layout, created a UI that's easy to navigate, and even added features like mood-based playlists and user-generated playlists. Seeing it come together was super rewarding, and it was amazing to see my friends use it and give me feedback. It was a great way to challenge myself and flex my creative muscles - and who knows, maybe one day it'll even get popular! I'm ecstatic to share that I'm excited to work on developing an innovative education platform that utilizes AI and data analysis to provide personalized learning experiences for students around the world. I envision a platform that leverages machine learning to identify learning gaps and offer tailored resources to bridge them, ultimately leading to increased academic success and confidence. I dream of making this platform a global phenomenon, allowing students from diverse backgrounds to have access to quality education and equal opportunities to thrive.
