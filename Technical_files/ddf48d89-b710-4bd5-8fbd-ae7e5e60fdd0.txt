I loved working on a personal AR project last semester, where I used Unity and JavaScript to create an interactive art piece that brought a local park's wildlife to life. It was amazing to see the animals and plants come alive on a mobile device. I also experimented with Google's ARCore and JavaScript to make it accessible on both iOS and Android. It was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed pushing the boundaries of what's possible in AR. It's projects like these that make me excited about the future of technology and its applications. As a 19-year-old student, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experience. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on developing innovative AR/VR experiences that merge reality with fantasy, revolutionizing the way we interact with each other and the world around us. I envision creating immersive environments that can enhance education, therapy, and entertainment, breaking down language barriers and cultural silos. The possibilities are endless, and I'm thrilled to be part of this exciting journey. I believe that with the power of coding and creativity, we can shape a brighter future.
