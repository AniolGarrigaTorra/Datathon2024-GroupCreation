I worked on a mobile app project in React Native, creating a virtual try-on feature for clothing. I designed the UI/UX and implemented the functionality to superimpose virtual clothes on real-life selfies. It was a challenge to get the AR experience right, but when it all came together, it was so cool! I loved seeing how it worked seamlessly, and people loved trying it on their own photos. As I look ahead, I'm thrilled to imagine myself making a significant impact in the field of extended reality. I've always been fascinated by the potential of AR/VR to transform the way we live, work, and interact. Within the next decade, I envision creating innovative, user-centric experiences that blend the physical and digital worlds seamlessly. With advancements in technologies like AI, computer vision, and cloud computing, I foresee myself working on augmented reality solutions that revolutionize industries such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to be part of this futuristic landscape!
