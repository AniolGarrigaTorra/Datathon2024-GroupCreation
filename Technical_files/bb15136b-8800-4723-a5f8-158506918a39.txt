I'm super excited to talk about my non-technical project - a social media campaign I created for a local food bank! As a freshman, I stumbled upon the idea to help spread awareness about food insecurity in our community. I designed eye-catching graphics, wrote engaging captions, and reached out to local influencers to collaborate. The response was amazing - our small town came together to donate a ton of canned goods and volunteers. Seeing the impact it had on our community gives me chills! It was an incredible feeling, knowing I made a difference. I'm beyond thrilled to talk about a project I've been conceptualizing in my spare time - developing a scalable education platform using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to revolutionize the way knowledge is disseminated, especially to underprivileged communities. My dream is to create a platform that leverages AI-powered chatbots to provide personalized learning experiences, accessible through any device with an internet connection. This platform could significantly bridge the education gap and make learning more efficient, effective, and inclusive. I envision it having a profound impact on global education, and I'm already envisioning the ripple effects it could have!
