I loved working on a project where I automated some repetitive tasks on my college's IoT-enabled bulletin board using Figma and Python. The board displayed students' names and schedules, but it was a hassle to update every term. I used a script to fetch data from the school's API, updated the displays, and even added an SMS notifications system. It was cool to see the techy part of my life bleed into my student organization work! The experience showed me how coding can simplify daily tasks, and I'm hoping to apply that mindset to future projects. I'm thrilled to think about the innovations I can be a part of in the next decade! In the realm of Cybersecurity, I envision a future where AI-powered solutions seamlessly detect and respond to threats, rendering humans less vulnerable to cyber-attacks. I'm particularly interested in exploring the intersection of Cybersecurity and IoT, where smart devices can adapt to threats in real-time. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a decentralized, autonomous security framework that safeguards global data transfers and applications. That's the kind of transformative work that gets me pumped for the future!
