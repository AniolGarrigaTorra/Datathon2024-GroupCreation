I recently worked on a passion project where I created a mobile app that helps music artists promote their upcoming shows using augmented reality (AR) filters. I enjoyed using computer vision to design and develop the AR features, and it was a blast to see it come to life. The project combined my love for music, art, and coding, making it a truly fulfilling experience. Working on this project taught me a lot about design thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, skills I believe will benefit me greatly in my future endeavors. It was an amazing feeling to see it published on the app store! I'm truly thrilled to see the potential impact that technology can have on our world, and I'm excited to be a part of it. In the next 10 years, I'm hoping to work on developing AI-powered systems that can aid in disaster response and recovery. Imagine having the ability to quickly sort through massive amounts of data, pinpointing areas of greatest need and allocating resources more efficiently. It's a lofty goal, but one that I think could have a profound impact on countless lives. The opportunity to contribute to such a cause is what drives me forward.
