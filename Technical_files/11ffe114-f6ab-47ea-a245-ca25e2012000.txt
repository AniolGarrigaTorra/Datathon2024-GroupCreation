Oh, I just loved working on my AR gaming project, Glimmer! It was my final project for my University's AR and VR course, and I got to combine my passion for gaming and tech. I designed and developed a 3D augmented reality mini-game using ARKit and Flutter. Players had to collect virtual gems hidden in the real world, using their phone's camera to track the environment. I learned so much about game development, physics, and human-computer interaction. It was an amazing experience, and I had a blast working on it! I'm thrilled to share that I'm utterly captivated by the prospect of pioneering a decentralized e-commerce platform that leverages blockchain and AR/VR technologies! Imagine a marketplace where consumers can immerse themselves in a virtual shopping experience, interact with products in a photorealistic environment, and seamlessly purchase items using a secure and transparent blockchain-based payment system. As a consumer and developer, I'm excited to be part of this revolutionary change, making online shopping more engaging, efficient, and secure. This dream project pushes me to explore the possibilities of web3, cryptography, and cutting-edge tech innovations!
