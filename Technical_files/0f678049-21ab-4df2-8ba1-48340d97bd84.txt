I'm really passionate about lifehacks, so I worked on a side project to develop a React-based todo list app with a personalized productivity coach integrated! I used Figma to design the UI, and Python to implement the algorithm for suggesting tasks based on users' goals and habits. I also set up a database with SQL and used Git for version control. It was an incredible feeling seeing my idea come to life, and I love how it's helped me stay organized and focused. Can't wait to improve it even more and maybe even open-source it! I'm thrilled to share that I've been mulling over this idea for a while now - developing a platform that utilizes blockchain technology to create a transparent and equitable online educational resource library! Imagine a space where open-source educational materials are curated, reviewed, and updated by a community of teachers, students, and experts from around the world. The blockchain aspect would ensure that authorship and contributions are securely tracked, preventing plagiarism and rewarding hard work. I'm eager to collaborate with others on this project and create a game-changing resource that democratizes access to quality education worldwide.
