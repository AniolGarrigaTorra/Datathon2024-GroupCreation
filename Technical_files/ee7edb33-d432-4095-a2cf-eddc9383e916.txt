I'd love to talk about a non-technical project that I enjoyed working on. It was an event I organized with some friends called Coding for Change. We invited local high school students to join us for a day and learn the basics of coding through hands-on workshops and games. It was amazing to see the kids light up when they created their own animations using Scratch! As the event organizer, I got to bring together people from different backgrounds and facilitate their learning experience. It was an incredible feeling, and I got to make a positive impact on my community. I'm thrilled to think about the potential impact I can make in the next 10 years! My ultimate goal is to apply my passion for education and social good to create a more accessible and inclusive learning environment. I envision developing AI-powered tools that use natural language processing to personalize and adapt educational content for students with special needs. Imagine it: a platform where students with autism can learn in their own way, using voice assistants to engage with material, and receive tailored support from educators and therapists. It's a daunting but inspiring challenge that I hope to tackle in the years to come.
