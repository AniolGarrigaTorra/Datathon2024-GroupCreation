I absolutely loved working on a personal project where I developed an augmented reality scavenger hunt for kids using AR.js and JavaScript! It was so much fun creating an immersive experience that brought the outdoors to their doors. I designed a web-based app that displayed interactive, 3D objects, and let kids point their devices to find and collect digital treasures. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of tech and art, and this project allowed me to combine those passions. Seeing the excitement on kids' faces when they discovered their virtual loot still gives me a huge smile! I'm thrilled to see the vast potential of Quantum Computing unfold in the next decade! I envision developing applications that integrate Quantum Computing with AR/VR technologies, revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, finance, and education. Imagine immersive experiences where patients can interact with virtual assistants designed to diagnose and treat diseases, or students can engage with quantum-powered 3D models to grasp complex concepts. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to contribute my skills in Machine Learning and Data Visualization to advance this ambitious frontier. It's exhilarating to think about the positive impact we can have with cutting-edge technology!
