Oh man, I'm totally obsessed with my AR-powered retail experience project! I built a prototype that allows customers to try on virtual outfits in a physical store using AR glasses. It was such a blast to work on - I got to combine my passion for retail and tech. I designed the UI/UX using Figma and then implemented it using Java and GCP. The machine learning model recognized products and customers' body shapes, making the try-on experience super seamless. Seeing customers' reactions when they tried on virtual outfits was pure magic. I hope to launch it soon and see how it changes the retail game! As a futurist at heart, I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities the next decade holds. I'm passionate about using technology to drive positive change, and I'm particularly excited about the potential of augmented reality to revolutionize various industries, from education to healthcare. Imagine being able to visualize 3D medical simulations, or attending virtual therapy sessions that feel like being in the same room as your counselor. My ultimate goal is to create an AR platform that enables anyone, regardless of geographical location, to access quality education and training, bridging the knowledge gap and empowering a more connected, inclusive world.
