I loved working on a React Native app for a friend's small business. It was my first solo project, and I got to design the UI/UX from scratch. I enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to implement features like offline storage and location services. But what made it truly enjoyable was seeing the impact it had on my friend's business. They were thrilled with the app, and it became a huge hit among their customers. Seeing that tangible result was incredible, and it gave me a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It was a blast, and I learned so much from it! As I look to the future, I'm genuinely thrilled to contemplate the prospect of working on developing more accessible and empowering Artificial Intelligence solutions. In the next 10 years, I envision AI being deeply integrated into our daily lives, making our interactions more seamless, efficient, and empathetic. I'd love to be a part of a team that creates cutting-edge AI systems that can help tackle complex societal issues, such as healthcare disparities, environmental sustainability, and educational inequality. By combining my interests in programming, design, and gaming, I aim to contribute to creating a more harmonious and inclusive human-AI future.
