I loved working on a project that combined my passions for Machine Learning and Health! I created a virtual wellness coach using a Raspberry Pi, IoT sensors, and machine learning algorithms. Users could input their fitness goals and daily activities, and the coach would provide personalized suggestions for improvement. It was awesome seeing how the system improved user engagement and behavior. What made it even more enjoyable was working on the UI/UX design and iOS app development for the coach's dashboard. It was a fantastic blend of technical and creative work that let me merge my diverse interests. I'm thrilled to share that I'm fascinated by the possibilities of integrating AI with telemedicine! In the next 10 years, I envision creating an AI-powered medical triage system that can diagnose and treat patients remotely. This system would utilize computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms to analyze patients' medical records, symptoms, and other factors to provide personalized treatment plans. I believe this technology could revolutionize healthcare, making quality care more accessible and efficient.
