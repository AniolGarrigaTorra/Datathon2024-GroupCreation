I had an absolute blast working on a personal project called EcoRenter! It's an IoT-powered smart bin system that uses sensors and machine learning to optimize waste collection. I built it using a Raspberry Pi, some custom Arduino code, and a dash of React Native. What I loved most was seeing my creations come to life and knowing that I was making a tangible difference in my community. I've been approached by local businesses to implement it in their parks, and it's been an incredible feeling to know my work is being used to make a positive impact. The possibilities are endless! In the next 10 years, I'm ecstatic about the prospect of working on a blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that focuses on sustainable development. My vision is to create a system that empowers people to take control of their financial lives, while also promoting environmental stewardship and social justice. I'm eager to dive into the world of DeFi, where I can utilize my skills in blockchain, machine learning, and data analysis to design an ecosystem that rewards responsible financial behaviors and incentivizes eco-friendly practices. It's a bold dream, but I'm ready to tackle the challenge!
