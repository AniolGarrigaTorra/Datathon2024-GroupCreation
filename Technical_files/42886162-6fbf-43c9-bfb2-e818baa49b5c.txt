I loved working on a project that aimed to use AI-powered chatbots to improve mental health support for marginalized communities. As a beginner, I was excited to learn about sentiment analysis and natural language processing using React. With the help of a friend who's more experienced, we built a basic chatbot that could recognize and respond to common mental health concerns. Seeing the bot's potential to make a difference inspired me to learn more about data science and ethics. It was my first time applying AI in a social good context, and it felt amazing to know that our work could have a real impact. I'm thrilled about the potential to develop AI-powered tools that amplify social impact. In the next 10 years, I envision working on projects that use machine learning to address pressing global issues, such as climate change, education inequality, or poverty reduction. With my growing programming skills and passion for social good, I hope to contribute to the creation of innovative solutions that can be applied in various settings, from non-profits to governments. By harnessing the power of AI, we can drive meaningful change and create a brighter future for all. The prospect of making a tangible difference keeps me energized!
