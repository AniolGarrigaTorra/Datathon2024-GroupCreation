One project that I thoroughly enjoyed working on is a personalized to-do list generator using machine learning. I used Python and TensorFlow to create a natural language processing model that could generate customized task lists based on a user's language and behavioral patterns. It was a great way for me to apply my NLP skills in a practical setting, and I loved seeing the lists come together! I was thrilled to share it with friends and family, and it even got a few enthusiastic requests to be made more functional (fingers crossed for next semester's project timeframe). I'm really thrilled about the prospect of working on sustainable urban planning and management solutions using data analysis and machine learning. In the next 10 years, I envision a future where my skills in NLP, data visualization, and machine learning enable me to develop AI-powered urban planning platforms that optimize city resource allocation, predict and mitigate the impact of climate change, and improve citizen quality of life. I'm excited to collaborate with cities and governments to design and deploy data-driven solutions that promote environmentally friendly and equitable urban development, and make a meaningful positive impact on the world.
