Man, I'm super proud of a non-technical project I worked on called Harmony. I curated a Spotify playlist that featured uplifting and diverse music from my favorite artists. I designed the visual elements, wrote the liner notes, and even created a social media campaign to share it with friends and like-minded music lovers. Seeing people connect with the playlist and share their own stories was an amazing experience. It's all about creating something that resonates with others, you know? I'm thrilled to envision a future where data analytics plays a crucial role in addressing healthcare inequities. In the next decade, I hope to contribute to developing AI-powered, IoT-enabled systems that use real-time data to optimize clinical trial outcomes, patient treatment plans, and public health resource allocation. My dream is to work on developing wearable devices and mobile applications that leverage AR/VR to educate patients, providers, and caregivers on chronic disease management, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It's a lofty goal, but I'm eager to dive in and make a meaningful impact.
