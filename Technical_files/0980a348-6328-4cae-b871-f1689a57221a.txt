Oh my gosh, I had the most fun working on a project to create a simple music playlist generator using Rust and PostgreSQL! I was able to use my skills in programming to create a algorithm that generated playlist based on user preferences. I even designed the layout and user interface using a graphic design tool. The best part was seeing it all come together and knowing that someone might actually use it. I'm thrilled to say that I'm currently obsessed with AI-powered music generation! Imagine being able to create mesmerizing soundtracks for films, games, or even entire albums with the aid of machine learning algorithms. With my background in design and voice skills, I envision designing intuitive interfaces for users to collaborate with AI to craft unique musical masterpieces. In the next 10 years, I hope to co-found a startup that revolutionizes the music industry by fusing creativity, tech, and innovation. It's a lofty goal, but I believe it's within reach, and the datathon experience could be a significant step towards making it a reality!
