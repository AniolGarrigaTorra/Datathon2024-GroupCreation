I recently worked on a project where I designed and built a simple augmented reality game for my school's annual festival. It was a non-technical project that allowed me to exercise my creativity in UI/UX design and AR/VR. I created a interactive character that players could use to capture other players' virtual pets by scanning QR codes around the festival area. The project was a huge success and it was amazing to see people of all ages and backgrounds using and enjoying the game. It was a great experience and showed me the impact that design and technology can have on people's experiences. What an excellent question! In the next 10 years, I'm absolutely thrilled to continue exploring the realm of augmented reality and virtual reality, potentially revolutionizing industries like education and healthcare. Imagine being able to learn about complex concepts through immersive, interactive AR experiences, or receiving VR therapy that simulates real-world environments to treat mental health conditions. As a tech enthusiast, I envision myself working on developing AI-powered, AR-based tools that empower individuals to upskill and reskill, while also pushing the boundaries of creative storytelling and art.

The possibilities are endless, and I can barely contain my excitement at the prospect of being a part of this groundbreaking technology's journey!
