I loved working on a project where I built a voice assistant for my mom, who's a busy entrepreneur, to help her manage her schedule and daily tasks! I used Flask to create a simple web app, integrated with a PostgreSQL database to store her tasks and calendar events. I also designed a user-friendly UI/UX using Android Studio. It was amazing to see her struggling with keeping track of her tasks, and then experiencing the relief and happiness when she started using my app! This project reminded me that tech can be practical and make a real difference in people's lives. I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastic about developing voice-activated virtual health assistants that can effectively diagnose and prevent chronic diseases. Leveraging my interests in Health, Voice skills, and IoT, I envision creating AI-powered voice assistants that can analyze individuals' health metrics, monitor vital signs, and provide personalized wellness recommendations. Imagine having a trusted companion that helps you optimize your daily routine, tracks your progress, and connects you with healthcare professionals when needed. The prospect of combining my technical skills with my passion for healthcare innovation gets me pumped, and I'm excited to work on projects that can make a real difference in people's lives.
