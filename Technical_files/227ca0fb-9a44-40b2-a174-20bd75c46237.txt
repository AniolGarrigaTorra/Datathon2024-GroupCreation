One of my favorite projects was building a chatbot for my school's library using Flutter. I'm an English literature major, but I love tinkering with tech, and this project allowed me to combine both interests. I designed the bot's layout in Figma and programmed its functionality using Flutter. I even added some humor and personality to make it more user-friendly! The final result was a functional chatbot that helped students navigate the library's resources and services. Seeing students use it and get a kick out of it made all the hard work worth it. I'm thrilled to think about what I'd love to accomplish in the next 10 years. Ideally, I'd like to co-found a startup that combines my passions for education, cybersecurity, and technology. The idea is to develop a platform that uses AI-powered analytics to create personalized security awareness training for students, making them more resilient against cyber threats. The goal is to empower the next generation of tech enthusiasts to tackle real-world problems while keeping them safe online. It's an ambitious vision, but I'm stoked to start laying the groundwork for it!
