One of my favorite projects was a mobile app for tracking fitness goals, which I developed using Android Studio and Java. As a gamer and fitness enthusiast, I combined my two passions to create an app that allowed users to track their exercise routines, set reminders, and earn rewards. I also integrated social media features, so users could share their progress with friends and join online communities for motivation. Seeing users engage with the app and track their progress was super fulfilling! It was a fun challenge to balance functionality and design, and I loved experimenting with different UI components. I'm ecstatic about the prospect of developing AI-powered prosthetic limbs that can seamlessly integrate with a person's nervous system. Imagine a world where individuals with amputations can regain their motor skills and freedom of movement. As an AR/VR enthusiast, I envision a future where these prosthetics can be augmented with augmented reality capabilities, allowing users to perceive and interact with their environment in a more intuitive and natural way. I'm excited to contribute to making this future a reality and empower people to live life to the fullest.
