Oh, oh! I'm so glad you asked! I once built a habit-tracking app using Flutter and Firebase. I was struggling to stick to my daily routine, and I thought, Hey, Aida, why not build something to help you stay on track? I designed the UI using Figma and wrote the backend using Firebase Firestore. It was my first time working with React Native, and I loved the challenge. The best part? I actually started using the app myself and it really helped me establish a consistent routine! Who knew coding could be a form of self-care? I'm thrilled to share my ambitious goals with you! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to contribute to creating innovative solutions that combine my passion for mobile, health, and cybersecurity. My dream is to develop a wearable AI-powered device that tracks vital signs and detects health anomalies, sending personalized recommendations for self-care and disease prevention. I envision this device to be seamless, intuitive, and secure, utilizing blockchain technology to ensure patient data protection. This project excites me because it integrates my interests, allows me to learn from top-notch mentors, and has the potential to positively impact people's lives worldwide.
