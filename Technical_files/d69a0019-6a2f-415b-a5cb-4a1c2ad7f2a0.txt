Oh, oh! I'm so excited to share one of my favorite projects with you! In my intro to data analysis class, we were tasked with creating a data visualization project that tackles a social good issue. I chose to explore poverty rates among different age groups in my hometown. I worked with a group to collect and clean the data, then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. Seeing the trends and patterns pop up was incredible! It was awesome to share our findings with the class and even got to present it at a local community event. I'm thrilled to share my ambition to develop AI-powered software that tackles environmental sustainability! I'm fascinated by the potential for machine learning to drive data-driven decision making in climate change mitigation. Imagine creating an intelligent system that helps businesses, governments, and individuals alike reduce their carbon footprint through optimized resource allocation and predictive analytics. I envision a world where data visualizations help people better understand the consequences of their actions and inspire positive changes. It's a lofty goal, but I'm eager to explore the intersection of tech and sustainability, and this datathon is the perfect catalyst for sparking my creativity!
