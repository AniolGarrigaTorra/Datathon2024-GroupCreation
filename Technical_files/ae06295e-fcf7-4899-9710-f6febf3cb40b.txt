I loved working on a Lifehacks blog, where I could share my favorite productivity tips and tricks with others. I used TypeScript to build a custom React app, which allows users to search and save their favorite hacks. I also implemented a recommendation algorithm to suggest hacks based on users' interests and usage patterns. The blog quickly gained popularity, and it's been an amazing feeling to see how something I built could make a difference in people's daily lives. It was a great way for me to combine my passion for productivity and programming! I'm thrilled to share that I'm envisioning myself as a leading developer in the intersection of fintech and blockchain, revolutionizing the way people manage their finances. Specifically, I dream of creating a decentralized, AI-driven platform that enables individuals to make smarter investment decisions and optimize their financial portfolios. Imagine being able to predict and adapt to market fluctuations in real-time, all while maintaining total control and security over your financial data. The potential for positive impact on the global financial landscape is immense, and I'm stoked to contribute to this exciting future!
