One project that still gets me pumped up is a wellness app I built during my summer break. I used Flutter to create a platform that lets users track their mood, sleep schedule, and exercise routine, providing personalized insights and recommendations. What I loved most was seeing how my friends started to open up about their mental health struggles and finding the app helped them feel more empowered to take control. Watching my creation bring positivity to people's lives was incredibly fulfilling! It reminded me of why I love coding - to make a difference and build connections with others. I'm thrilled to think about the future! In the next decade, I'm envisioning a project that combines my passions for healthcare, machine learning, and art. I'd love to work on a groundbreaking AI-powered diagnostic tool that uses augmented reality to help doctors diagnose rare and debilitating diseases more accurately and efficiently. Imagine being able to visualize complex medical data in a 3D environment, allowing medical professionals to identify patterns and connections that might have gone unnoticed before. This fusion of art, science, and innovation excites me, and I believe it has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry.
