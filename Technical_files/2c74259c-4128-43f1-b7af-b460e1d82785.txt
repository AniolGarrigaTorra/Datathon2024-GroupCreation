I had an absolute blast working on a data visualization project with friends! We collected environmental data from sensors and turned it into interactive, web-based dashboards. I handled the iOS development, creating a mobile app to collect data and send it to the cloud. We used D3.js for the visualization, which was a real brain-twister for me, but super rewarding when it all came together. It was amazing to see our creation impact friends and family, who could now easily monitor the quality of the air they breathed! I'm thrilled to envision myself working on a cutting-edge project that harmonizes technology and social impact. In the next 10 years, I'm eager to develop an AI-powered platform that uses machine learning to aid organizations in need, such as disaster relief efforts or poverty alleviation programs. By analyzing vast amounts of data, this platform could provide real-time insights to optimize resource distribution, track progress, and connect marginalized communities with essential services. As a social entrepreneur, I'm passionate about combining my love for programming and passion for social good to create a positive impact that resonates globally.
