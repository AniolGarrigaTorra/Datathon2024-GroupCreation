I'm so excited to share a project that I had an absolute blast working on! During my sophomore year, I built a personal finance management app using Go and Flask. It was a web-based app that allowed users to track their expenses, set budgets, and receive alerts when they went over budget. What made this project special was that it was my first time using a framework like Flask, and I got to explore a whole new world of back-end development. Seeing the app come to life and watching my friends use it was incredibly rewarding! I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities in the next decade! I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and education, and I'd love to contribute to developing AI-powered educational platforms that make learning more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable. Specifically, I'd like to explore creating adaptive learning systems that utilize blockchain to ensure data privacy and security. I envision a future where students can learn anywhere, anytime, and have personalized learning experiences that cater to their individual needs and abilities. That's a pretty ambitious goal, but I'm excited to see where my skills take me in achieving it!
