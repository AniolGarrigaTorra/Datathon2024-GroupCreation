One of my favorite projects is actually a Lifehacks-themed social media bot I built using Python and PostgreSQL. I've always loved productivity tips and tricks, so I created a bot that shares them with my friends and followers. I coded it to curate the best content from my favorite blogs and hashtags, and even included a feature that allows users to request specific topics or categories. Seeing it come to life and making a positive impact on my friends' daily routines is super fulfilling! It's projects like this that remind me why I love coding - it's all about solving real-world problems and making a difference. I'm thrilled to share that I'm stoked about the prospect of working on a revolutionary project that combines data science and sustainability. In the next 10 years, I envision creating an AI-powered, community-driven platform that utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to analyze environmental data and provide actionable insights for environmentally-friendly urban planning. The platform would facilitate collaboration between policymakers, urban planners, and citizens to design and implement eco-friendly infrastructure. I'm excited about the potential to make a positive impact on climate change, and I believe that my datathon experience will be a stepping stone in achieving this ambitious goal.
