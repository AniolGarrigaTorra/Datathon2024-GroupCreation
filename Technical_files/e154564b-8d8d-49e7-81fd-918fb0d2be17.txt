I'd be happy to share a project that I really enjoyed working on! During my university's hackathon last semester, I worked on a personal project that combined my interests in Fintech and Computer Vision. I created an Android app that used TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect and analyze users' facial expressions, and it would offer personalized investment advice based on the user's emotional state! It was so much fun to see my idea come to life, and I learned a ton about both tech and finance in the process. I'm really excited to work on Quantum Computing Applications! With the advent of quantum computers, I foresee a revolutionary shift in the way we approach complex problems in various fields, including finance, optimization, and cryptography. I'd love to contribute to the development of quantum-resistant cryptography and explore the applications of quantum computers in finance, particularly in predictive modeling and portfolio optimization. It's a challenging and fascinating field that requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, linear algebra, and programming. I'm eager to learn and contribute to the advancements in this area, making a tangible impact in the future.
