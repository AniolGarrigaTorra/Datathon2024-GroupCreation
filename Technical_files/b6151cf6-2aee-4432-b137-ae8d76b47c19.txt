I loved working on a project where I built a voice assistant for my friends' small local bakery using Google Assistant Actions! I'm a huge foodie, and I loved combining my passion with my skills. I learned about intent schema, Dialogflow, and webhooks, which was amazing. The best part was seeing my friends' faces light up when I demoed it to them - they were so thrilled to be able to place orders and get recipe suggestions just by asking! It was an incredible feeling, knowing I helped create something practical and useful. Now I'm always on the lookout for more Voice UI projects! I'm thrilled to share that I've been fascinated by the concept of developing a conversational AI-driven learning platform for students with special needs. Imagine a system that could utilize machine learning to personalize educational content, providing a more effective and engaging learning experience for children with unique abilities. With my background in programming and interest in voice skills, I'm confident that I can contribute to making this vision a reality. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm excited to see where my skills can take me and how I can make a positive impact on the lives of others.
