One project I really enjoyed was building a simple home automation system using Raspberry Pi and the Internet of Things (IoT). I've always been fascinated by smart homes, so I decided to give it a try. I set up sensors to track temperature and humidity, and then used Rust programming to create a dashboard that allowed me to monitor and control the devices remotely. It was a great learning experience, and I loved seeing my ideas come to life. It was also super satisfying to have my smart home lights turning on and off just with my voice command! I'm thrilled to think about what the future holds, and in the next 10 years, I'm eager to dive into the development of wearable devices that focus on improving mental health. With advancements in IoT and augmented reality, I envision wearables that can detect early signs of anxiety and depression, providing personalized coping mechanisms and mental wellness resources. It's a realm that combines my passion for IoT, Rust programming, and making a positive impact - a truly interdisciplinary pursuit that has the potential to revolutionize the way we address mental health. The prospect of creating innovative solutions that could enhance people's lives is what gets me excited!
