I loved working on a project that combined my passion for design and technology - building a virtual closet app using React Native! I created a personalized styling experience where users can upload their wardrobe items, receive outfit suggestions, and even book virtual styling sessions with experts. The app was a hit among my friends, and I had a blast designing the UI/UX and seeing the feedback. It was a great opportunity to apply my skills in Android development, Flutter, and SQL to create something functional and visually appealing. It's still one of my proudest projects to date! What an exciting question! In the next 10 years, I'm thrilled to tackle a project that blends my passions for machine learning, e-commerce, and design - developing a smart personal shopping assistant powered by AI. I envision an AI-driven stylist that recommends fashion products to consumers based on their unique style, preferences, and body type. The assistant would be integrated with online stores and provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. With blockchain technology, we could ensure secure transactions and protect consumer data. My goal is to create an innovative solution that makes a significant impact on the retail industry.
