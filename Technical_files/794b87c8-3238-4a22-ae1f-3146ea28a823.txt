One project that stands out to me is when I built a health monitoring system using Arduino and computer vision. I developed a system that tracked the posture and movement of people with disabilities, providing real-time feedback to help improve their physical therapy exercises. It was a rewarding experience as I combined my interests in health and IoT to make a tangible difference. I enjoyed working on the hardware and software aspects, experimenting with different sensors and algorithms to create a robust system. Seeing the potential impact it could have motivated me to keep pushing boundaries and exploring innovative solutions! I'm thrilled about the prospect of creating AI-powered exoskeletons that could potentially revolutionize the way people with mobility impairments live and interact with their surroundings. By integrating advanced computer vision, machine learning, and IoT technologies, I envision these exoskeletons becoming sophisticated personal assistants, providing assistive care and facilitating independence for individuals with physical disabilities. My goal is to design intuitive interfaces and algorithms that empower users to control their exoskeletons with ease, opening up new avenues for social and professional engagement. It's an ambitious project, but I'm eager to tackle the challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible.
