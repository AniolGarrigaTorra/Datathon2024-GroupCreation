I had a blast working on a project that integrated Machine Learning with Computer Vision to create an augmented reality (AR) museum tour. I built the AR app using React Native, allowing visitors to explore exhibit information, videos, and interactive experiences using their smartphones. The computer vision component allowed for object recognition and tracking, making it feel like the exhibits came to life! It was an incredible feeling to see my project come together, and I enjoyed the challenge of overcoming technical hurdles to create an engaging user experience. It's projects like this that remind me why I love coding in the first place! As I see it, the next 10 years will be revolutionized by the convergence of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. I'm thrilled at the prospect of contributing to the development of Quantum-secured AI-powered cyberdefenses, which could fundamentally shift the way we protect our digital infrastructure. Imagine an Internet where malicious agents can be detected and neutralized in real-time, without compromising the secrecy of sensitive data. The idea sends shivers down my spine! The thrill of pushing the boundaries of what's possible is what drives me, and I can hardly wait to see where this journey takes me.
