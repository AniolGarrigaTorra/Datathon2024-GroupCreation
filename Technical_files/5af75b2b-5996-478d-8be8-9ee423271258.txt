I really enjoyed working on a machine learning-based piano learning app during my winter break. I used TensorFlow to build a neural network that could recognize hand positioning and generate custom lessons for users. The IoT aspect came in handy when I integrated it with a motion sensing keyboard I built, allowing users to track their progress in real-time. Seeing my friends improve their piano skills with my app was a huge motivation, and it was awesome to see the technical and creative aspects come together! I'm thrilled to think about the future! One thing that's really getting me pumped is the prospect of working on AI-powered musical instrument systems. Imagine a guitar that can analyze your playing style, offer real-time feedback, and even suggest new melodies and chord progressions based on your performance. The possibilities are endless - it could revolutionize music composition, provide a new therapeutic outlet for folks with physical disabilities, and even enhance the creative process for artists. The intersection of music, AI, and neuroscience is an area I'm excited to explore, and who knows, maybe I'll be the one building the first AI-powered instrument orchestra!
