One of my favorite projects was creating an AR-enabled fitness coach for iOS. I was excited to combine my interest in AR/VR with my passion for health and fitness. I worked with a team to develop an app that used AR technology to guide users through personalized workouts. It was awesome to see our app come to life, and even more rewarding to test it with friends and family, watching them get motivated to stay active. We used Xcode, ARKit, and Swift to build it, and it was a blast learning about the challenges and possibilities of AR development. The future is vast and exciting! In the next decade, I'd love to see blockchain technology transform the way we approach sustainability. Imagine an ecosystem where supply chain transparency and efficient resource allocation come together to reduce waste, conserve energy, and support responsible consumption. I envision a world where decentralized platforms connect consumers directly with eco-friendly manufacturers, reducing unnecessary packaging, and promoting a sharing economy for shared responsibility. This futuristic vision has me hyped, and I believe my skills in programming and interest in blockchain can contribute to making it a reality.
