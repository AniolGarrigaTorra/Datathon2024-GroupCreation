I had a blast working on a React Native project to build a voice-controlled fitness tracker! I paired machine learning algorithms with speech recognition to create a smart personal trainer that offers customized workout routines based on the user's voice commands. I loved combining my interest in AI, Voice Skills, and Health into one project. It was challenging, but the result was so cool - I could shout Hey, Ari! Let's do burpees! and my app would start counting down the exercises for me. It was an amazing feeling to see something I created come to life! I'm thrilled to envision a future where I can contribute to developing more inclusive and secure healthcare platforms using cutting-edge machine learning and blockchain technologies. My dream project is to design an AI-powered platform that empowers individuals to better manage their medical records, access personalized health recommendations, and ensure seamless data sharing among healthcare providers. I'd love to lead a multidisciplinary team to bring this vision to life, leveraging my skills in programming languages like Go and Rust to craft a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform that positively impacts people's lives. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to take the first step in making it a reality!
