I absolutely loved working on a React project where I created a virtual tour experience using 360-degree images and Augmented Reality. It was a passion project that allowed me to combine my interests in AR/VR and Machine Learning. I learned so much about Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics, and React's state management. It was exciting to see my creation come to life, allowing users to explore different environments virtually. The project also sparked my interest in applying AR/VR to real-world problems, such as therapy and education. I felt a sense of accomplishment and couldn't wait to build more projects like it! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about creating an innovative, AI-powered healthcare system that enables personalized medicine and enhanced patient care. In the next 10 years, I envision a future where AR/VR technology helps diagnose and treat mental health conditions more effectively. With Machine Learning algorithms, medical professionals can analyze vast amounts of patient data to identify treatment regimens tailored to individual needs. It's an ambitious goal, but I believe that by leveraging cutting-edge tech, we can revolutionize the healthcare landscape and make a significant positive impact on people's lives.
