I recently worked on a non-technical project that I really enjoyed - designing and building a custom gaming setup for a local LAN party event! I'm a huge gamer myself, so it was amazing to take my passion and skills (which are limited to building and modding PCs) and create something truly unique. It was a blast setting up an immersive experience with RGB lights, custom controllers, and a giant screen. Seeing people's reactions when they played with it was incredible! It was a blast, and I hope to do more projects like that in the future. I'm thrilled to say that I'm passionate about making a significant impact in the world through the power of technology. In the next decade, I aim to contribute to the development of cutting-edge IoT systems that promote sustainable and responsible resource management. Imagine a future where our homes, communities, and cities are self-sustaining ecosystems that thrive on renewable energy, recycling, and efficient waste management. I envision a world where individuals have access to accurate and actionable data on their environmental footprint, empowering them to make informed decisions about their daily habits. This is the kind of transformative innovation I'm excited to work on.
