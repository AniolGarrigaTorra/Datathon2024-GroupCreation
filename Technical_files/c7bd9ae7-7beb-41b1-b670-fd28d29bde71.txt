I've had a blast working on a non-technical project - building a virtual reality experience to help children with anxiety learn to navigate school. I teamed up with some friends who were designers and art students to create a interactive VR scenario where kids could practice facing fears and feeling more confident. It was amazing to see how just a short while in the VR world could help kids overcome their worries! Not only did I learn some new tech skills, but it was incredible to see the impact we could have on someone's life. I'm really thrilled about the prospect of working on developing augmented reality experiences that blend seamlessly into our daily lives. Imagine having virtual personal assistants that can anticipate our needs, or immersive training simulations that revolutionize the way we learn new skills. The potential to enhance healthcare, education, and other industries with AR is vast. As someone who's fascinated by computer vision and flutter, I'm excited to contribute to this field and push the boundaries of what's possible. The next 10 years are going to be exhilarating, and I can't wait to be a part of it!
