I loved working on a personal project where I built a smart home automation system using IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller. It was super cool to see my creation come to life, automatically turning on lights and adjusting temperature based on my presence. I wrote the firmware using C++ and implemented it on the microcontroller. Then, I created a user-friendly dashboard using React and IoT SDKs to visualize and control the system remotely. This project showcased my skills in embedded systems, IoT, and web development. It was an incredible feeling to see my code in action, making my daily life more convenient! I'm thrilled to share that in the next 10 years, I'd love to be a key contributor to developing revolutionary AR/VR-based intelligent assistants that seamlessly integrate with daily life. Imagine having a personalized AI-powered mentor, trained on my interests, goals, and habits, that uses Augmented Reality to provide step-by-step guidance, enhance productivity, and foster a deeper understanding of the world. This could democratize access to specialized knowledge, simplify complex tasks, and bring about a new era of human-machine collaboration. My dream is to play a crucial role in shaping this future and experiencing the transformative power it brings.
