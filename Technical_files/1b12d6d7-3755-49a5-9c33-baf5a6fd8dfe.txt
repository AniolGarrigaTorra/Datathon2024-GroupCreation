I loved working on a personal project where I created a VR art studio using Unity and Blender. I combined my passion for art and tech to build a immersive environment where users can create and manipulate virtual sculptures. I spent countless hours experimenting with different materials, textures, and lighting effects to achieve a surreal atmosphere. It was a blast to see my friends and family try it out and see the amazement in their eyes. Although it was a technically challenging project, the creative freedom and sense of accomplishment made it an unforgettable experience. As a curious mind, I'm always looking to the horizon, dreaming about what the future holds. In the next 10 years, I'm particularly excited about the advancement of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential applications. Imagine having AI that can learn, adapt, and improve at an exponential rate, revolutionizing industries and our daily lives. I envision AGI-powered tools that seamlessly integrate art, science, and technology, enabling people to solve some of humanity's most pressing challenges. To be a part of that revolution excites me - it's a prospect that fuels my passion for tech and motivates me to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
