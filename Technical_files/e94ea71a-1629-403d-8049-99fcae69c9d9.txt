I had an absolute blast working on a retail project for my Data Science class! We were tasked with analyzing customer purchase habits and predicting future purchases for an online e-commerce store. I was in charge of data preprocessing and visualization using Python and Tableau. What I loved was seeing the real-world impact of data science - being able to identify trends and make recommendations that could increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. It was so cool to see the impact of my work and knowing that it could make a difference! I'm thrilled to think about the next 10 years! As someone with a passion for social good and education, I'm excited to develop innovative solutions that empower marginalized communities through digital education. I envision creating an AI-powered platform that uses machine learning to identify educational gaps and creates personalized, interactive learning pathways for students in underserved areas. By bridging the digital divide, we can create a more level playing field, giving these communities the tools and resources they need to thrive. My ultimate goal is to make education a fundamental human right, accessible to all.
