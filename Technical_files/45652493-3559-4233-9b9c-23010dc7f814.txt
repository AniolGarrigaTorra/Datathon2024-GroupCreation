I loved working on a project where I built a voice-controlled to-do list app using Flutter and Google Assistant! I've always been fascinated by natural language processing, and this project let me explore it. I designed the UI using Figma and integrated it with the app. It was so cool to see my app come to life and hear myself talking to it every day! I'm excited to contribute to the development of secure, AI-powered financial platforms that can democratize access to financial services for the underprivileged. I've always been fascinated by Fintech's potential to reshape the global financial landscape. In the next 10 years, I envision myself leading a team that designs and deploys innovative solutions utilizing machine learning and blockchain technology to create more transparent and inclusive financial systems. It's a daunting task, but I believe the rewards will be immense, and I'm thrilled to be a part of the journey to create a more equitable future for everyone.
