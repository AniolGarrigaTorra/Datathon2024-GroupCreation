I had a blast working on a personal project where I combined my love for gaming and IoT. I created a customizable, smart gaming chair using Arduino and sensors to track player heart rate, biometric data, and gaming performance. Using TensorFlow, I trained a machine learning model to predict game scores and provide personalized recommendations. The project allowed me to combine my technical skills with my passion for gaming, and I loved the creative freedom to experiment and learn new technologies. It's a great example of how datathons and projects like these can help you learn while having fun! What a thrilling question! As a student of Computer Science, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and medicine. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to contribute to the development of wearable, AI-powered, and IoT-integrated health monitoring systems. Imagine being able to track your vital signs and receive personalized health recommendations, all while your phone and smartwatch work together to anticipate and prevent potential health issues. I envision integrating sensors, machine learning, and data visualization to empower individuals to take control of their health and wellness, revolutionizing the way we prevent and manage diseases.
