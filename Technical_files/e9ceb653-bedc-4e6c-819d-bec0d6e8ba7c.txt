I had so much fun working on a personal project to analyze my Spotify listening habits! I used Python and data visualization tools to track my top artists, genres, and playlists over time. It was amazing to see the patterns and surprises that emerged from my data. I even built a simple web scraper to collect my listening history and added some animations to make the visualizations pop. It was a great combination of data analysis, creativity, and fun. Who knew staring at code could be so... therapeutic? I'm thrilled about the prospect of working on a project that bridges my passions for technology, social good, and art. In the next 10 years, I envision creating a pioneering platform that utilizes AI-powered chatbots to empower at-risk youth with mental health resources and support networks. The platform, HopeBox, would be a holistic ecosystem offering personalized advice, connecting them with counselors, and even facilitating art therapy sessions. As a communication and fintech enthusiast, I'd love to integrate cryptocurrency donations, making it easy for supporters to contribute and help create positive change.
