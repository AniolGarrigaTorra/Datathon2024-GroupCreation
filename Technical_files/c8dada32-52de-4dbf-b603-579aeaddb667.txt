I loved working on a personal project where I created an interactive AR filter using iOS development and ARKit. I was fascinated by the idea of bringing designs to life, so I designed a 3D logo of my favorite band and animated it using Core Animation. It was amazing to see the logo come alive on my phone screen! I enjoyed the creative process of design, coding, and testing. Although it wasn't complex in terms of programming, it was a fun way to express myself and combine my passions for AR, design, and coding. I'm really excited to dive into the world of Augmented Reality (AR) in the next 10 years! I've always been fascinated by the idea of blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds. I envision creating immersive, interactive experiences that enhance our daily lives, like smart glasses that provide real-time language translation or AR interfaces that transform public spaces into interactive playgrounds. My goal is to become a pioneer in this field, developing innovative AR solutions that revolutionize industries and change the way we live and interact with each other. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to get started!
