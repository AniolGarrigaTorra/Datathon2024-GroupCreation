I'm so excited to share a project I really enjoyed! I created a small health tracking app for my siblings as a hobby project. I used TypeScript to build it, and it was amazing to see how I could bring my ideas to life. The app allows users to track their daily habits, like exercise and eating habits, and sets reminders and rewards for healthy behavior. I loved working on it, as it was so fulfilling to see my family members using it and saying it was really helpful. It was also great to learn how to structure my code and organize my project! I'm super stoked to say that I'm passionate about revolutionizing the healthcare industry through data-driven innovations. In the next 10 years, I hope to contribute to the development of personalized medicine platforms that utilize machine learning and AI to diagnose diseases more accurately and effectively. Imagine being able to predict and prevent illnesses before they even surface! As a fintech enthusiast, I envision integrating financial and health data to offer patients more transparent and affordable treatment options. It's a tall order, but I'm all about disrupting the status quo and making a meaningful impact in people's lives.
