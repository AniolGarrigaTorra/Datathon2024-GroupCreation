I'm so stoked to share this with you! I created a web platform called EcoCycle where people can easily recycle electronics by generating a barcode that shows its recyclability score. I used React Native for the app and PyTorch for the machine learning model to predict the material composition. The goal was to make recycling more accessible and environmental-friendly. I collaborated with local recycling centers and non-profits to promote the platform. It was a blast working on this project, from brainstorming to launching it with a local event. I felt so accomplished when I saw people using it and knowing it was making a difference! I'm thrilled to think about the potential of using data to drive positive change in the world. In the next 10 years, I'd love to work on developing AI-powered solutions that help organizations and governments allocate resources more effectively to combat social and environmental issues. Specifically, I'd like to create a platform that uses machine learning to identify areas of most need and connect them with the necessary resources and experts. It's a lofty goal, but I believe that combining data analysis with community engagement could make a real difference in bridging the gap between those who have and those who don't.
