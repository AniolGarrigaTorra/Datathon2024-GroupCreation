I recently worked on a project to develop a mobile app using Flutter that helps people schedule medical appointments more efficiently. I loved the process of researching and understanding the medical scheduling workflow, then translating that into a user-friendly interface. It was a challenging project, but I enjoyed the creative freedom and seeing my ideas come to life. I also appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students, getting feedback and learning from each other's strengths. It was a rewarding experience that made me excited to take on more projects like this! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to tackle a project that combines my passions for education and healthcare. I envision creating an AI-powered personalized learning platform for medical students, where they can access tailored course materials, interactive simulations, and virtual mentorship. The platform would utilize natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time feedback, helping students become better equipped to diagnose and treat patients. My goal is to make medical education more accessible, efficient, and effective, ultimately enhancing patient care worldwide. I'm looking forward to diving deep into the details and learning from others during the datathon.
