I loved working on a project called VoiceForEducation, a smart library system that uses IoT sensors to track book readings and shares them on a voice-enabled assistant. I worked on the backend using Flask and SQL to create a database management system for the library's book collection. It was a fascinating project that combined my interests in Education and Voice skills. Seeing the system in action and hearing students' reactions to its simplicity and functionality was truly rewarding. I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to make a meaningful impact on the world through technology. My dream project is to develop an AI-powered educational platform that utilizes IoT sensors and voice skills to create personalized learning experiences for students worldwide. This platform would enable teachers to track student progress, identify learning gaps, and provide tailored support in real-time. Imagine empowering students to take ownership of their education, boosting engagement, and promoting a lifelong love of learning! It's an ambitious goal, but I'm confident that the right blend of tech and passion can make it a reality.
