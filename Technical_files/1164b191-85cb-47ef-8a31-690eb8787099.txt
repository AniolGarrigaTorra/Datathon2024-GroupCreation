One project that really stands out to me is when I built a simple Android app to help homeless shelters manage donations. It was my first time diving into mobile development, and I was blown away by how much impact a small app could have. I loved researching the needs of the shelters and translating that into a functional, user-friendly design. Seeing the shelters actually using the app to track donations and allocate resources was incredibly fulfilling. It was a great experience that showed me the importance of using tech to make a positive impact. I'm thrilled to be working on making healthcare more accessible and equitable for underserved communities through the convergence of blockchain, AI, and voice interfaces. Imagine being able to request medical appointments, receive diagnoses, and access crucial health information through voice-assisted technologies like Alexa or Google Assistant. Blockchain's decentralized nature would ensure data privacy and security, while AI would help identify trends and patterns in health data to improve healthcare outcomes. My ultimate goal is to create a platform that empowers individuals to take control of their health journey and receives quality care without geographic or socioeconomic barriers.
