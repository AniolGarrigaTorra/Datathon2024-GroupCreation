I had so much fun working on a project where I built a simple music recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). I collected a dataset of song lyrics and trained a model to generate personalized recommendations based on users' favorite songs. It was amazing to see how the AI could identify patterns and suggestions that I wouldn't have thought of! The project allowed me to combine my passions for music and tech, and I even shared it with my friends and family who loved giving feedback. It was a fantastic way to stay engaged with NLP and learn something new. I'm thrilled to share that I've always been fascinated by the convergence of technology and art. In the next decade, I envision working on projects that bring together AI-powered musical composition and generative design to revolutionize the entertainment industry. Imagine a world where musicians can co-create with AI, and architects can design immersive, interactive structures that respond to the environment. My long-term goal is to pioneer a company that democratizes artistic expression through technology, empowering creatives to push boundaries and craft new realities. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to be a part of shaping the future!
