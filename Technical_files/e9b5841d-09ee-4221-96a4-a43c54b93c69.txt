I had a blast working on a musical recommender system project using computer vision and natural language processing! I used Python and Flask to build the backend and deployed it on Heroku. The system analyzes music genres and artist styles from song lyrics and album art to create personalized playlists for users. I even collaborated with a designer to create a beautiful UI. Seeing users discover new music and enjoying the recommendations made it all worth it! I'm absolutely thrilled about the prospect of developing AI-powered education platforms that have the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact with each other. Imagine a world where children can learn from their peers and experienced mentors across the globe, fostering a sense of global citizenship and social awareness. As a programming enthusiast, I'm excited to explore the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to create a more immersive and engaging educational experience. It's a lofty goal, but I believe technology can have a profound impact on shaping a better future for us all.
