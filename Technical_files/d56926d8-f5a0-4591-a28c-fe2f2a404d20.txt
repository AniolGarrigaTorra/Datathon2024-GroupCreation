I worked on a mobile app called MoodMates that helps individuals manage their mental well-being by pairing them with music recommendations based on their mood! As a flutter developer, I designed the UI/UX, built the app, and integrated music streaming services. The app also uses Natural Language Processing to detect a user's mood and suggest appropriate tracks. Seeing people connect with music that spoke to them made it all worthwhile. It was an incredible experience to marry my love for music, art, and coding. Now, I'm excited to leverage this passion during the datathon and make some unforgettable memories! I'm thrilled to share that I'm enthusiastic about exploring the potential of blockchain technology to create a more equitable and transparent global society. I envision working on developing Decentralized Applications (dApps) that empower marginalized communities and amplify their voices. Imagine a world where everyone has equal access to essential services, education, and opportunities, and blockchain technology can help bridge the gap. As a developer, I'm excited to contribute to creating decentralized platforms that foster inclusivity, innovation, and social impact. It's an ambitious goal, but I believe it's achievable, and I'm eager to be a part of this revolutionary movement.
