I just loved working on my capstone project for my Machine Learning course, where I built a facial recognition system using TensorFlow and Computer Vision! It was my first real-world application of ML, and I was stoked to see my code come to life. I worked with a partner, and it was amazing to see our collaboration lead to a working prototype. We even demo'd it to our prof, who was super impressed. I learned so much about face recognition algorithms, data preprocessing, and implementing the project as a web app using Flask. Can't wait to share my learnings with the datathon crowd! I'm thrilled to share that I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions that fuse Web, IoT, and Blockchain technologies to create personalized learning experiences that revolutionize the way we learn. I envision a future where students can seamlessly interact with intelligent, web-based educational platforms that utilize real-time data and feedback from IoT sensors to adapt to their unique learning needs. These platforms would also utilize Blockchain to securely store and authenticate student progress, making it a game-changer for education. I believe that with cutting-edge tech and creative problem-solving, we can create a more accessible, inclusive, and effective learning landscape.
