I had a blast working on a project that combined my interests in Machine Learning and Mobile Development! I built a Flutter app that used computer vision to help visually impaired individuals recognize objects in their surroundings. It was amazing to see how something as simple as scanning a QR code could make a significant difference in their daily lives. I loved learning about edge cases, iterating on the algorithm, and polishing the user interface. Working on this project was a great reminder that with technology, we can create meaningful and accessible solutions that positively impact people's lives. As I dive deeper into the world of tech, I find myself fixated on the intersection of human behavior and robotics. I'm thrilled to envision a future where robots are designed to seamlessly interact with people, understanding their emotions and needs. I'm eager to develop more advanced AI and ML capabilities that enable robots to navigate complex environments, learn from humans, and adapt to unexpected situations. The idea of building a future where robots are an integral part of our daily lives, improving our well-being and making our lives more efficient, is truly exhilarating and has me buzzing with excitement!
