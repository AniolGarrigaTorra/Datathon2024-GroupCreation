Oh, I'm totally stoked to talk about this! I built aReact Native app for my college project, which aimed to connect students with local mentorship programs. It was my first mobile app development project, and I loved seeing my idea come to life. I designed the app's UI/UX, implemented a matching algorithm using TensorFlow, and deployed it on AWS. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I got to work with my classmates on designing the overall flow. Seeing our hard work make a difference in the community made it all worth it! I'm truly fired up about developing AI-powered, inclusive education platforms! As someone who's always been passionate about social good, I believe technology can be a powerful tool in bridging the gap in global education access. I'd love to create a platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized learning experiences for students with different learning abilities, backgrounds, and learning styles. This would enable anyone, regardless of geographical constraints or financial means, to access quality education and unlock their full potential. The thought of making a tangible impact on education equity gets me pumped!
