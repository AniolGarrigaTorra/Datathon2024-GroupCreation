I'm really proud of a personal project I worked on, building a fitness tracker mobile app using React Native. I wanted to create a simple and user-friendly app that tracked workouts and provided reminders for consistent exercise. I learned a lot about UI/UX design and React Native's features, like animations and gestures. I even added a habit-tracking feature that usesmachine learning to suggest customized workout plans based on the user's preferences and progress. It was an awesome experience to see my idea come to life, and I plan to continue developing and improving it! I'm thrilled to think about the possibilities! In the next 10 years, I'm eager to be working on creating sustainable and accessible financial solutions for underprivileged communities. As a fintech enthusiast, I envision building AI-powered chatbots that can provide tailored financial advice to people struggling to make ends meet. I'd love to develop a system that uses machine learning to identify at-risk individuals and connect them with emergency funding sources. This way, people can better navigate the complex financial landscape and achieve a more secure future.
