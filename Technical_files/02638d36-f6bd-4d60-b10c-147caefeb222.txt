One project that stands out to me was a Computer Vision-based chatbot I built for my university's student union. I combined my Python skills with MongoDB to create a platform that could recognize and respond to simple questions from students about events, clubs, and services. The chatbot used facial recognition to identify students and provide personalized information. I was thrilled to see it in action at the student fair, and even more proud when our president reached out to thank me for a smashing job! It was a fun project that demonstrated the power of applying tech to everyday life. I'm thrilled to think about the innovations that the future holds! In the next 10 years, I'm excited to see the widespread adoption of augmented reality (AR) in education. Imagine being able to wear a headset that brings historical landmarks to life, allows you to dissect virtual frog dissections without any harm to the environment, or connects you with distant classrooms for seamless language learning. The potential to reimagine the learning experience is boundless, and I'm eager to contribute to this shift. I envision AR-powered education revolutionizing the way we think, learn, and interact with each other.
