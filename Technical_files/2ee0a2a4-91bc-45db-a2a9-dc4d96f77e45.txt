I really enjoyed working on a project to develop a chatbot for educational purposes. As a third-year student, I'm passionate about using technology to improve learning experiences. I used Python to design and build a bot that can answer frequently asked questions about programming concepts. I integrated it with AWS Alexa to enable voice interaction. It was exciting to see my code come to life and users engaging with the bot to learn more about programming. The project not only tested my programming skills but also sparked my interest in exploring AI and NLP in the context of education. I'm thrilled to share my aspirations! In the next decade, I envision working on a project that combines my passions for Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Education. I aim to develop an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that leverages RPA and IoT to provide personalized educational experiences for underprivileged children worldwide. The platform would use data visualization and machine learning algorithms to analyze learning patterns, offer real-time feedback, and provide students with tailored educational content and resources. It's a lofty goal, but I believe the impact could be life-changing, and I'm excited to contribute to shaping the future of education.
