I had so much fun working on a personal project where I created an AR gaming experience using Go programming language! I designed a simple mini-game that used hand gestures to control characters, and it was amazing to see it come to life. I learned so much about spatial interactions and how to utilize Go's concurrency features. I presented it at a school hackathon and received feedback from fellow coders, which was super valuable. It was great to see how coding could be used to create something interactive and engaging. I'm thrilled to think about the next 10 years and the potential opportunities that lie ahead! I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and daily life, and I envision myself working on projects that bring people closer together. One area that excites me is the development of augmented reality interfaces that empower individuals with special needs to overcome communication barriers. Imagine a world where people with Autism or ALS can seamlessly interact with others, using AR technology to augment their communication skills. It's a challenge that pushes the boundaries of coding and empathy, and I'm eager to contribute to making it a reality!
