I loved working on a personal project where I created a simple AR game using Apple's ARKit and Swift programming language. The game allowed users to build and destroy 3D structures with their fingers. It was my first real-world project using ARKit, and I learned so much from experimenting with different features and behaviors. Seeing my idea come to life and being able to share it with friends and family was incredibly rewarding. It was a great way to combine my interests in gaming, AR, and iOS development, and I plan to continue building on it and exploring its potential. I'm thrilled to envision my aspirations for the next decade. As I delve into the world of innovation, I'm excited to collaborate on developing AR/VR applications that revolutionize the way we learn and interact with each other. I envision creating immersive educational experiences, allowing students to embark on interactive journeys that foster deeper understanding and retention. Imagine, for instance, donning a VR headset to relive ancient civilizations, or virtually exploring the intricate workings of the human brain - the possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to be part of shaping this future.
