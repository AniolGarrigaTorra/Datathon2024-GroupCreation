I recently worked on a personal project, building a voice assistant using TypeScript and Flask. I had always been fascinated by the potential of natural language processing and wanted to explore it further. The project involved creating a simple chatbot that could understand basic voice commands, integrate with Google Calendar, and provide updates on tasks and schedules. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my programming skills in a new and creative way. Seeing my project come to life and watching it interact with users was an amazing feeling! I'm thrilled to envision a future where I'm contributing to the development of innovative health-related technologies. In the next 10 years, I'm excited to work on creating cutting-edge, AI-powered AR/VR solutions that revolutionize patient diagnosis, treatment, and recovery processes. Imagine a world where clinicians can remotely interact with patients' digital avatars, visualizing medical simulations in real-time to enhance patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. As a programmer, the prospect of combining my skills in machine learning, blockchain, and UI/UX design to create such groundbreaking applications is truly what gets me excited!
