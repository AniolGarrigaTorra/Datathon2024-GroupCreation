I loved working on my personal project, a mobile app called MoodMinder! It's a social platform where users can anonymously share their daily emotions, and connect with others who are feeling the same way. I designed the interface using HTML/CSS and iOS development, and built the app's back-end with PostgreSQL. I also used PyTorch for a machine learning model to analyze user trends and offer personalized suggestions for improving their mental well-being. It was an incredible feeling to see my idea come to life and know that it could potentially help people feel less alone. I'm thrilled to share that I'm eager to delve deeper into the realm of augmented reality (AR) and its potential applications in finance. Imagine walking into a bank and having a virtual assistant guide you through financial transactions, effortlessly educating you on budgeting and investment strategies. I envision developing an intuitive AR interface that utilizes natural language processing to simplify complex financial concepts, enabling users to make informed decisions with confidence. The intersection of AR and Fintech holds immense promise, and I'm excited to contribute to shaping this future, revolutionizing the way we interact with money and data.
